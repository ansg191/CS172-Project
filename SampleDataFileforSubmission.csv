en.wikipedia.org,U-Net - Wikipedia,"is a   that was developed for biomedical   at the Computer Science Department of the  .  The network is based on a fully   whose architecture was modified and extended to work with fewer training images and to yield more precise  . Segmentation of a 512 × 512 image takes less than a second on a modern  .
 The U-Net architecture has also been employed in   for iterative image denoising.  This technology underlies many modern image generation models, such as  ,  , and  .
 The U-Net architecture stems from the so-called “fully convolutional network” proposed by Long, Shelhamer, and Darrell in 2014. 
 The main idea is to supplement a usual contracting network by successive layers, where pooling operations are replaced by   operators. Hence these layers increase the resolution of the output. A successive convolutional layer can then learn to assemble a precise output based on this information. 
 One important modification in U-Net is that there are a large number of feature channels in the upsampling part, which allow the network to propagate context information to higher resolution layers. As a consequence, the expansive path is more or less symmetric to the contracting part, and yields a u-shaped architecture. The network only uses the valid part of each   without any fully connected layers.  To predict the pixels in the border region of the image, the missing context is extrapolated by mirroring the input image. This tiling strategy is important to apply the network to large images, since otherwise the resolution would be limited by the   memory.
 U-Net was created by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, Thomas Brox in 2015 and reported in the paper “U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation”.  It is an improvement and development of FCN: Evan Shelhamer, Jonathan Long, Trevor Darrell (2014). ""Fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation"". 
 The network consists of a contracting path and an expansive path, which gives it the u-shaped architecture. The contracting path is a typical convolutional network that consists of repeated application of  , each followed by a   (ReLU) and a   operation. During the contraction, the spatial information is reduced while feature information is increased. The expansive pathway combines the feature and spatial information through a sequence of up-convolutions and concatenations with high-resolution features from the contracting path. 
 There are many applications of U-Net in biomedical  , such as brain image segmentation (''BRATS'' ) and liver image segmentation (""siliver07"" ) as well as protein binding site prediction.  U-Net implementations have also found use in the physical sciences, for example in the analysis of micrographs of materials.  Variations of the U-Net have also been applied for medical image reconstruction.  Here are some variants and applications of U-Net as follows:",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Example_architecture_of_U-Net_for_producing_k_256-by-256_image_masks_for_a_256-by-256_RGB_image.png/220px-Example_architecture_of_U-Net_for_producing_k_256-by-256_image_masks_for_a_256-by-256_RGB_image.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-Net
en.wikipedia.org,C++ - Wikipedia,"( , pronounced "" "" and sometimes abbreviated as  ) is a  ,   created by Danish computer scientist  . First released in 1985 as an extension of the  , it has since expanded significantly over time; as of 1997 , C++ has  ,  , and   features, in addition to facilities for     manipulation for making things like   or to make operating systems like   or  . It is almost always implemented as a  , and many vendors provide  , including the  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . 
 C++ was designed with   and  , resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with  , efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.  C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,  including  ,  ,   (e.g.,  ,  , or  ), and performance-critical applications (e.g.,   or  ). 
 C++ is standardized by the   (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as   (informally known as  ).  The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as  , which was then amended by the  ,  ,  , and   standards. The current   standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged  . Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Stroustrup at   since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided   for program organization.  Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule  with   as the next planned standard. 
 In 1979,  , a Danish  , began work on "" "", the predecessor to C++.  The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that   had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while   was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in  , he had the problem of analyzing the     with respect to  . Remembering his PhD experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the   language with  -like features.  C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable, and widely used. In addition to C and Simula's influences, other languages influenced this new language, including  ,  ,  , and  . 
 Initially, Stroustrup's ""C with Classes"" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including  ,  ,  ,  , and  . 
 In 1982, Stroustrup started to develop a successor to C with Classes, which he named ""C++"" (  being the   in C) after going through several other names. New features were added, including  , function name and  ,  , constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL-style single-line comments with two forward slashes ( ). Furthermore, Stroustrup developed a new, standalone compiler for C++,  .
 In 1984, Stroustrup implemented the first stream input/output library. The idea of providing an output operator rather than a named output function was suggested by   (who had previously suggested  ).
 In 1985, the first edition of   was released, which became the definitive reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard.  The first commercial implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year. 
 In 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of   in 1991.  New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions,  , and protected members. In 1990,   was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions included  ,  ,  , new  , and a  .
 In 1998, C++98 was released, standardizing the language, and a minor update ( ) was released in 2003.
 After C++98, C++ evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the   standard was released, adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities to C++ programmers. After a minor   update released in December 2014, various new additions were introduced in  .  After becoming finalized in February 2020,  a draft of the C++20 standard was approved on 4 September 2020, and officially published on 15 December 2020. 
 On January 3, 2018, Stroustrup was announced as the 2018 winner of the   for Engineering, ""for conceptualizing and developing the C++ programming language"". 
 As of December 2022 , C++ ranked third on the  , surpassing   for the first time in the history of the index. It ranks third, after   and  . 
 According to Stroustrup, ""the name signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from C.""  This name is credited to Rick Mascitti (mid-1983)  and was first used in December 1983. When Mascitti was questioned informally in 1992 about the naming, he indicated that it was given in a   spirit. The name comes from C's     (which   the   of a  ) and a common   of using ""+"" to indicate an enhanced computer program.
 During C++'s development period, the language had been referred to as ""new C"" and ""C with Classes""  before acquiring its final name.
 Throughout C++'s life, its development and evolution has been guided by a set of principles: 
 C++ is standardized by an   working group known as  . So far, it has published six revisions of the C++ standard and is currently working on the next revision,  .
 In 1998, the ISO working group standardized C++ for the first time as  , which is informally known as  . In 2003, it published a new version of the C++ standard called  , which fixed problems identified in C++98.
 The next major revision of the standard was informally referred to as ""C++0x"", but it was not released until 2011.     (14882:2011) included many additions to both the core language and the standard library. 
 In 2014,   (also known as C++1y) was released as a small extension to C++11, featuring mainly bug fixes and small improvements.   The Draft International Standard ballot procedures completed in mid-August 2014. 
 After C++14, a major revision  , informally known as C++1z, was completed by the ISO C++ committee in mid July 2017 and was approved and published in December 2017. 
 As part of the standardization process, ISO also publishes  :
 More technical specifications are in development and pending approval, including new set of concurrency extensions.
 The C++ language has two main components: a direct mapping of hardware features provided primarily by the C subset, and zero-overhead abstractions based on those mappings. Stroustrup describes C++ as ""a light-weight abstraction programming language [designed] for building and using efficient and elegant abstractions"";  and ""offering both hardware access and abstraction is the basis of C++. Doing it efficiently is what distinguishes it from other languages."" 
 C++ inherits most of  . The following is Bjarne Stroustrup's version of the   that uses the   stream facility to write a message to  : 
 As in C, C++ supports four types of  : static storage duration objects, thread storage duration objects, automatic storage duration objects, and dynamic storage duration objects. 
 Static storage duration objects are created before   is entered (see exceptions below) and destroyed in reverse order of creation after   exits. The exact order of creation is not specified by the standard (though there are some rules defined below) to allow implementations some freedom in how to organize their implementation. More formally, objects of this type have a lifespan that ""shall last for the duration of the program"". 
 Static storage duration objects are initialized in two phases. First, ""static initialization"" is performed, and only   all static initialization is performed, ""dynamic initialization"" is performed.  In static initialization, all objects are first initialized with zeros; after that, all objects that have a constant initialization phase are initialized with the constant expression (i.e. variables initialized with a literal or  ). Though it is not specified in the standard, the static initialization phase can be completed at compile time and saved in the data partition of the executable.  Dynamic initialization involves all object initialization done via a constructor or function call (unless the function is marked with  , in C++11). The dynamic initialization order is defined as the order of declaration within the compilation unit (i.e. the same file). No guarantees are provided about the order of initialization between compilation units.
 Variables of this type are very similar to static storage duration objects. The main difference is the creation time is just prior to thread creation and destruction is done after the thread has been joined. 
 The most common variable types in C++ are local variables inside a function or block, and temporary variables.  The common feature about automatic variables is that they have a lifetime that is limited to the scope of the variable. They are created and potentially initialized at the point of declaration (see below for details) and destroyed in the   order of creation when the scope is left. This is implemented by allocation on the  .
 Local variables are created as the point of execution passes the declaration point. If the variable has a constructor or initializer this is used to define the initial state of the object. Local variables are destroyed when the local block or function that they are declared in is closed. C++ destructors for local variables are called at the end of the object lifetime, allowing a discipline for automatic resource management termed  , which is widely used in C++.
 Member variables are created when the parent object is created. Array members are initialized from 0 to the last member of the array in order. Member variables are destroyed when the parent object is destroyed in the reverse order of creation. i.e. If the parent is an ""automatic object"" then it will be destroyed when it goes out of scope which triggers the destruction of all its members.
 Temporary variables are created as the result of expression evaluation and are destroyed when the statement containing the expression has been fully evaluated (usually at the   at the end of a statement).
 These objects have a dynamic lifespan and can be created directly with a call to   and destroyed explicitly with a call to  .  C++ also supports   and  , from C, but these are not compatible with   and  . Use of   returns an address to the allocated memory. The C++ Core Guidelines advise against using   directly for creating dynamic objects in favor of smart pointers through   for single ownership and   for reference-counted multiple ownership,  which were introduced in C++11.
  enable  .   supports function, class, alias, and variable templates. Templates may be parameterized by types, compile-time constants, and other templates. Templates are implemented by   at compile-time. To instantiate a template, compilers substitute specific arguments for a template's parameters to generate a concrete function or class instance. Some substitutions are not possible; these are eliminated by an overload resolution policy described by the phrase "" "" (SFINAE). Templates are a powerful tool that can be used for  ,  , and code optimization, but this power implies a cost. Template use may increase   size, because each template instantiation produces a copy of the template code: one for each set of template arguments, however, this is the same or smaller amount of code that would be generated if the code were written by hand.  This is in contrast to run-time generics seen in other languages (e.g.,  ) where at compile-time the type is erased and a single template body is preserved.
 Templates are different from  : while both of these compile-time language features enable conditional compilation, templates are not restricted to lexical substitution. Templates are aware of the semantics and type system of their companion language, as well as all compile-time type definitions, and can perform high-level operations including programmatic flow control based on evaluation of strictly type-checked parameters. Macros are capable of conditional control over compilation based on predetermined criteria, but cannot instantiate new types, recurse, or perform type evaluation and in effect are limited to pre-compilation text-substitution and text-inclusion/exclusion. In other words, macros can control compilation flow based on pre-defined symbols but cannot, unlike templates, independently instantiate new symbols. Templates are a tool for static   (see below) and  .
 In addition, templates are a compile-time mechanism in C++ that is  , meaning that any computation expressible by a computer program can be computed, in some form, by a   prior to runtime.
 In summary, a template is a compile-time parameterized function or class written without knowledge of the specific arguments used to instantiate it. After instantiation, the resulting code is equivalent to code written specifically for the passed arguments. In this manner, templates provide a way to decouple generic, broadly applicable aspects of functions and classes (encoded in templates) from specific aspects (encoded in template parameters) without sacrificing performance due to abstraction.
 C++ introduces   (OOP) features to C. It offers  , which provide the four features commonly present in OOP (and some non-OOP) languages:  ,  ,  , and  . One distinguishing feature of   classes compared to classes in other programming languages is support for deterministic  , which in turn provide support for the   (RAII) concept.
  is the hiding of information to ensure that data structures and operators are used as intended and to make the usage model more obvious to the developer. C++ provides the ability to define classes and functions as its primary encapsulation mechanisms. Within a class, members can be declared as either public, protected, or private to explicitly enforce encapsulation. A public member of the class is accessible to any function. A private member is accessible only to functions that are members of that class and to functions and classes explicitly granted access permission by the class (""friends""). A protected member is accessible to members of classes that inherit from the class in addition to the class itself and any friends.
 The object-oriented principle ensures the encapsulation of all and only the functions that access the internal representation of a type. C++ supports this principle via member functions and friend functions, but it does not enforce it. Programmers can declare parts or all of the representation of a type to be public, and they are allowed to make public entities not part of the representation of a type. Therefore, C++ supports not just object-oriented programming, but other decomposition paradigms such as  .
 It is generally considered good practice to make all   private or protected, and to make public only those functions that are part of a minimal interface for users of the class. This can hide the details of data implementation, allowing the designer to later fundamentally change the implementation without changing the interface in any way. 
  allows one data type to acquire properties of other data types. Inheritance from a   may be declared as public, protected, or private. This access specifier determines whether unrelated and derived classes can access the inherited public and protected members of the base class. Only public inheritance corresponds to what is usually meant by ""inheritance"". The other two forms are much less frequently used. If the access specifier is omitted, a ""class"" inherits privately, while a ""struct"" inherits publicly. Base classes may be declared as virtual; this is called  . Virtual inheritance ensures that only one instance of a base class exists in the inheritance graph, avoiding some of the ambiguity problems of multiple inheritance.
  is a C++ feature allowing a class to be derived from more than one base class; this allows for more elaborate inheritance relationships. For example, a ""Flying Cat"" class can inherit from both ""Cat"" and ""Flying Mammal"". Some other languages, such as   or  , accomplish something similar (although more limited) by allowing inheritance of multiple   while restricting the number of base classes to one (interfaces, unlike classes, provide only declarations of member functions, no implementation or member data). An interface as in C# and Java can be defined in   as a class containing only pure virtual functions, often known as an   or ""ABC"". The member functions of such an abstract base class are normally explicitly defined in the derived class, not inherited implicitly. C++ virtual inheritance exhibits an ambiguity resolution feature called  .
 C++ provides more than 35 operators, covering basic arithmetic, bit manipulation, indirection, comparisons, logical operations and others. Almost all operators can be   for user-defined types, with a few notable exceptions such as member access (  and  ) and the conditional operator. The rich set of overloadable operators is central to making user-defined types in C++ seem like built-in types.
 Overloadable operators are also an essential part of many advanced C++ programming techniques, such as  . Overloading an operator does not change the precedence of calculations involving the operator, nor does it change the number of operands that the operator uses (any operand may however be ignored by the operator, though it will be evaluated prior to execution). Overloaded "" "" and "" "" operators lose their   property.
  enables one common interface for many implementations, and for objects to act differently under different circumstances.
 C++ supports several kinds of   (resolved at  ) and   (resolved at  )  , supported by the language features described above.   does not allow for certain run-time decisions, while   typically incurs a performance penalty.
  allows programs to declare multiple functions having the same name but with different arguments (i.e.  ). The functions are distinguished by the number or types of their  . Thus, the same function name can refer to different functions depending on the context in which it is used. The type returned by the function is not used to distinguish overloaded functions and differing return types would result in a compile-time error message.
 When declaring a function, a programmer can specify for one or more parameters a  . Doing so allows the parameters with defaults to optionally be omitted when the function is called, in which case the default arguments will be used. When a function is called with fewer arguments than there are declared parameters, explicit arguments are matched to parameters in left-to-right order, with any unmatched parameters at the end of the parameter list being assigned their default arguments. In many cases, specifying default arguments in a single function declaration is preferable to providing overloaded function definitions with different numbers of parameters.
  provide a sophisticated mechanism for writing generic, polymorphic code (i.e.  ). In particular, through the  , it is possible to implement a form of static polymorphism that closely mimics the syntax for overriding virtual functions. Because C++ templates are type-aware and  , they can also be used to let the compiler resolve recursive conditionals and generate substantial programs through  . Contrary to some opinion, template code will not generate a bulk code after compilation with the proper compiler settings. 
 Variable pointers and references to a base class type in C++ can also refer to objects of any derived classes of that type. This allows arrays and other kinds of containers to hold pointers to objects of differing types (references cannot be directly held in containers). This enables dynamic (run-time) polymorphism, where the referred objects can behave differently, depending on their (actual, derived) types.
 C++ also provides the   operator, which allows code to safely attempt conversion of an object, via a base reference/pointer, to a more derived type:  . The   is necessary as often one does not know which derived type is referenced. ( , conversion to a more general type, can always be checked/performed at compile-time via  , as ancestral classes are specified in the derived class's interface, visible to all callers.)   relies on   (RTTI), metadata in the program that enables differentiating types and their relationships. If a   to a pointer fails, the result is the   constant, whereas if the destination is a reference (which cannot be null), the cast throws an exception. Objects   to be of a certain derived type can be cast to that with  , bypassing RTTI and the safe runtime type-checking of  , so this should be used only if the programmer is very confident the cast is, and will always be, valid.
 Ordinarily, when a function in a derived class   a function in a base class, the function to call is determined by the type of the object. A given function is overridden when there exists no difference in the number or type of parameters between two or more definitions of that function. Hence, at compile time, it may not be possible to determine the type of the object and therefore the correct function to call, given only a base class pointer; the decision is therefore put off until runtime. This is called  .   or   allow the most specific implementation of the function to be called, according to the actual run-time type of the object. In C++ implementations, this is commonly done using  . If the object type is known, this may be bypassed by prepending a   before the function call, but in general calls to virtual functions are resolved at run time.
 In addition to standard member functions, operator overloads and destructors can be virtual. An inexact rule based on practical experience states that if any function in the class is virtual, the destructor should be as well. As the type of an object at its creation is known at compile time, constructors, and by extension copy constructors, cannot be virtual. Nonetheless, a situation may arise where a copy of an object needs to be created when a pointer to a derived object is passed as a pointer to a base object. In such a case, a common solution is to create a   (or similar) virtual function that creates and returns a copy of the derived class when called.
 A member function can also be made ""pure virtual"" by appending it with   after the closing parenthesis and before the semicolon. A class containing a pure virtual function is called an  . Objects cannot be created from an abstract class; they can only be derived from. Any derived class inherits the virtual function as pure and must provide a non-pure definition of it (and all other pure virtual functions) before objects of the derived class can be created. A program that attempts to create an object of a class with a pure virtual member function or inherited pure virtual member function is ill-formed.
 C++ provides support for  , also known as  , with the following form:
 Since C++20, the keyword   is optional for template parameters of lambda expressions:
 If the lambda takes no parameters, and no return type or other specifiers are used, the () can be omitted; that is,
 The return type of a lambda expression can be automatically inferred, if possible; e.g.:
 The   list supports the definition of  . Such lambda expressions are defined in the standard as   for an unnamed  .
 Exception handling is used to communicate the existence of a runtime problem or error from where it was detected to where the issue can be handled.  It permits this to be done in a uniform manner and separately from the main code, while detecting all errors.  Should an error occur, an exception is thrown (raised), which is then caught by the nearest suitable exception handler. The exception causes the current scope to be exited, and also each outer scope (propagation) until a suitable handler is found, calling in turn the destructors of any objects in these exited scopes.  At the same time, an exception is presented as an object carrying the data about the detected problem. 
 Some C++ style guides, such as Google's,  LLVM's,  and Qt's,  forbid the usage of exceptions.
 The exception-causing code is placed inside a   block. The exceptions are handled in separate   blocks (the handlers); each   block can have multiple exception handlers, as it is visible in the example below. 
 It is also possible to raise exceptions purposefully, using the   keyword; these exceptions are handled in the usual way. In some cases, exceptions cannot be used due to technical reasons. One such example is a critical component of an embedded system, where every operation must be guaranteed to complete within a specified amount of time. This cannot be determined with exceptions as no tools exist to determine the maximum time required for an exception to be handled. 
 Unlike  , in which the handling function is called from the point of failure, exception handling exits the current scope before the catch block is entered, which may be located in the current function or any of the previous function calls currently on the stack.
 C++ has enumeration types that are directly inherited from C's and work mostly like these, except that an enumeration is a real type in C++, giving added compile-time checking. Also (as with structs), the C++   keyword is combined with a  , so that instead of naming the type  , simply name it  . This can be simulated in C using a typedef:  
  also provides a second kind of enumeration, called a  . These are type-safe: the enumerators are not implicitly converted to an integer type. Among other things, this allows I/O streaming to be defined for the enumeration type. Another feature of scoped enumerations is that the enumerators do not leak, so usage requires prefixing with the name of the enumeration (e.g.,   for the first enumerator in the example below), unless a   declaration (introduced in  ) has been used to bring the enumerators into the current scope. A scoped enumeration is specified by the phrase   (or  ). For example:
 The   of an enumeration is an implementation-defined integral type that is large enough to hold all enumerated values; it does not have to be the smallest possible type. The underlying type can be specified directly, which allows ""forward declarations"" of enumerations:
 The C++   consists of two parts: the core language and the standard library. C++ programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of C++; it includes aggregate types ( , lists, maps, sets, queues, stacks, arrays, tuples),   (find,  ,  , random_shuffle, etc.), input/output facilities ( , for reading from and writing to the console and files), filesystem library, localisation support,   for automatic memory management,   support,   library, atomics support (allowing a variable to be read or written to by at most one thread at a time without any external synchronisation), time utilities (measurement, getting current time, etc.), a system for converting error reporting that does not use C++   into C++ exceptions, a  , and a slightly modified version of the   (to make it comply with the C++ type system).
 A large part of the C++ library is based on the   (STL). Useful tools provided by the STL include   as the collections of objects (such as   and  ),   that provide array-like access to containers, and   that perform operations such as searching and sorting.
 Furthermore, (multi)maps ( ) and (multi)sets are provided, all of which export compatible interfaces. Therefore, using templates it is possible to write generic algorithms that work with any container or on any sequence defined by iterators. As in C, the   of the   are accessed by using the     to include a  . The   provides 105 standard headers, of which 27 are deprecated.
 The standard incorporates the STL that was originally designed by  , who experimented with generic algorithms and containers for many years. When he started with C++, he finally found a language where it was possible to create generic algorithms (e.g., STL sort) that perform even better than, for example, the C standard library qsort, thanks to C++ features like using inlining and compile-time binding instead of function pointers. The standard does not refer to it as ""STL"", as it is merely a part of the standard library, but the term is still widely used to distinguish it from the rest of the standard library (input/output streams, internationalization, diagnostics, the C library subset, etc.). 
 Most C++ compilers, and all major ones, provide a standards-conforming implementation of the C++ standard library.
 The C++ Core Guidelines  are an initiative led by Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of C++, and Herb Sutter, the convener and chair of the C++ ISO Working Group, to help programmers write 'Modern C++' by using best practices for the language standards C++11 and newer, and to help developers of compilers and static checking tools to create rules for catching bad programming practices.
 The main aim is to efficiently and consistently write type and resource safe C++.
 The Core Guidelines were announced  in the opening keynote at CPPCon 2015.
 The Guidelines are accompanied by the Guideline Support Library (GSL),  a header only library of types and functions to implement the Core Guidelines and static checker tools for enforcing Guideline rules. 
 To give compiler vendors greater freedom, the C++ standards committee decided not to dictate the implementation of  ,  , and other implementation-specific features. The downside of this decision is that   produced by different   is expected to be incompatible. There are, however, attempts to standardize compilers for particular machines or  . For example, the Itanium C++ ABI is processor-independent (despite its name) and is implemented by GCC and Clang. 
 C++ is often considered to be a superset of   but this is not strictly true.  Most C code can easily be made to compile correctly in C++ but there are a few differences that cause some valid C code to be invalid or behave differently in C++. For example, C allows implicit conversion from   to other pointer types but C++ does not (for type safety reasons). Also, C++ defines many new keywords, such as   and  , which may be used as identifiers (for example, variable names) in a C program.
 Some incompatibilities have been removed by the 1999 revision of the C standard ( ), which now supports C++ features such as line comments ( ) and declarations mixed with code. On the other hand, C99 introduced a number of new features that C++ did not support that were incompatible or redundant in C++, such as  , native complex-number types (however, the   class in the C++ standard library provides similar functionality, although not code-compatible), designated initializers,  , and the   keyword.  Some of the C99-introduced features were included in the subsequent version of the C++ standard,   (out of those which were not redundant).  However, the C++11 standard introduces new incompatibilities, such as disallowing assignment of a string literal to a character pointer, which remains valid C.
 To intermix C and C++ code, any function declaration or definition that is to be called from/used both in C and C++ must be declared with C linkage by placing it within an   block. Such a function may not rely on features depending on   (i.e., function overloading).
 Despite its widespread adoption, some notable programmers have criticized the C++ language, including  ,   ,   ,  ,  and  . 
 
One of the most often criticised points of C++ is its perceived complexity as a language, with the criticism that a large number of non-orthogonal features in practice necessitates restricting code to a subset of C++, thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by  :   I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold, and yet there are a lot of people programming it. But what you do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, ""Yes, we're using C++ but we're not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we're not using operator overloading."" There are just a bunch of features that you're not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don't think it's good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else's code, which I think is such a good thing.   (1993, commenting on pre-standardized C++), who said of   that ""to think of programming in C++"" ""would make him physically ill"":    The problem that I have with them today is that... C++ is too complicated. At the moment, it's impossible for me to write portable code that I believe would work on lots of different systems, unless I avoid all exotic features. Whenever the C++ language designers had two competing ideas as to how they should solve some problem, they said ""OK, we'll do them both"". So the language is too baroque for my taste.  , who was a colleague of Stroustrup at Bell Labs, gives his assessment:    It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it's a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it's just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it's personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it's not a good language to transport an algorithm—to say, ""I wrote it; here, take it."" It's way too big, way too complex. And it's obviously  .
Stroustrup campaigned for years and years and years, way beyond any sort of technical contributions he made to the language, to get it adopted and used. And he sort of ran all the standards committees with a whip and a chair. And he said ""no"" to no one. He put every feature in that language that ever existed. It wasn't cleanly designed—it was just the union of everything that came along. And I think it suffered drastically from that.  
However  , also a colleague at Bell Labs, disputes this assessment:   C++ has been enormously influential. ... Lots of people say C++ is too big and too complicated etc. etc. but in fact it is a very powerful language and pretty much everything that is in there is there for a really sound reason: it is not somebody doing random invention, it is actually people trying to solve real world problems. Now a lot of the programs that we take for granted today, that we just use, are C++ programs.  Stroustrup himself comments that C++ semantics are much cleaner than its syntax: ""within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out."" 
 Other complaints may include a lack of   or  , long compilation times, perceived  ,  and verbose error messages, particularly from template metaprogramming.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/ISO_C%2B%2B_Logo.svg/120px-ISO_C%2B%2B_Logo.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/16px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/BjarneStroustrup.jpg/220px-BjarneStroustrup.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/20160121_CppFRUG_Joel_Falcou_CppQuiz_3.jpg/220px-20160121_CppFRUG_Joel_Falcou_CppQuiz_3.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/C%2B%2B_Standards_Committee_meeting_-_July_1996_Stockholm_-_Wednesday_general_session.jpg/220px-C%2B%2B_Standards_Committee_meeting_-_July_1996_Stockholm_-_Wednesday_general_session.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/ANSI_ISO_C%2B%2B_WP.jpg/220px-ANSI_ISO_C%2B%2B_WP.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Octicons-terminal.svg/24px-Octicons-terminal.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/14px-Commons-logo.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/16px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg/19px-Wikibooks-logo.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Wikiversity_logo_2017.svg/21px-Wikiversity_logo_2017.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/16px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/db/Symbol_list_class.svg/16px-Symbol_list_class.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/16px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/16px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B
en.wikipedia.org,C Sharp (programming language) - Wikipedia,"(   )  is a       supporting multiple  . C# encompasses static typing,   ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,    ( -based), and   programming disciplines. 
 The C# programming language was designed by   from   in 2000 and was later approved as an   by   (ECMA-334) in 2002 and  /  (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619 ) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with   and  , both of which were  . At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a   project called   began, providing a     and   for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released   (code editor),   (compiler), and   (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform. Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET.
 As of November 2023,  the most recent stable version of the language is C# 12.0, which was released in 2023 in .NET 8.0. 
 The Ecma standard lists these design goals for C#: 
 During the development of the  , the   were originally written using a   compiler system named   (SMC).  In January 1999,   formed a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for ""  Object Oriented Language"".  Microsoft had considered keeping the name ""Cool"" as the final name of the language, but chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the July 2000  , the language had been renamed C#, and the class libraries and   runtime had been ported to C#.
 Hejlsberg is C#'s principal designer and lead architect at Microsoft, and was previously involved with the design of  ,     (formerly   Delphi,   Delphi and   Delphi), and  . In interviews and technical papers, he has stated that flaws  in most major programming languages (e.g.  ,  ,  , and  ) drove the fundamentals of the   (CLR), which, in turn, drove the design of the C# language.
 , who created the   programming language in 1994, and  , a co-founder of  , the originator of Java, called C# an ""imitation"" of Java; Gosling further said that ""[C# is] sort of Java with reliability, productivity and security deleted.""  
In July 2000, Hejlsberg said that C# is ""not a Java clone"" and is ""much closer to C++"" in its design. 
 Since the release of C# 2.0 in November 2005, the C# and Java languages have evolved on increasingly divergent trajectories, becoming two quite different languages. One of the first major departures came with the addition of   to both languages, with vastly different implementations. C# makes use of   to provide ""first-class"" generic objects that can be used like any other class, with   performed at class-load time. 
Furthermore, C# has added several major features to accommodate functional-style programming, culminating in the   extensions released with C# 3.0 and its supporting framework of  ,  , and  .   These features enable C# programmers to use functional programming techniques, such as  , when it is advantageous to their application. The LINQ extensions and the functional imports help developers reduce the amount of   that is included in common tasks like querying a database, parsing an xml file, or searching through a data structure, shifting the emphasis onto the actual program logic to help improve readability and maintainability. 
 C# used to have a   called Andy (named after  ). It was retired on January 29, 2004. 
 C# was originally submitted to the ISO/IEC JTC 1 subcommittee   for review,  under ISO/IEC 23270:2003,  was withdrawn and was then approved under ISO/IEC 23270:2006.  The 23270:2006 is withdrawn under 23270:2018 and approved with this version. 
 Microsoft first used the name C# in 1988 for a variant of the C language designed for incremental compilation.  That project was not completed, and the name was later reused.
 The name ""C sharp"" was inspired by the musical notation whereby a   indicates that the written note should be made a   higher in  . 
This is similar to the language name of  , where ""++"" indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1 after being evaluated. The sharp symbol also resembles a   of four ""+"" symbols (in a two-by-two grid), further implying that the language is an increment of C++. 
 Due to technical limitations of display (standard fonts, browsers, etc.) and the fact that the sharp symbol (    ( )) is not present on most  , the   (    ( )) was chosen to approximate the sharp symbol in the written name of the programming language. 
This convention is reflected in the ECMA-334 C# Language Specification. 
 The ""sharp"" suffix has been used by a number of other .NET languages that are variants of existing languages, including   (a .NET language also designed by Microsoft that is derived from Java 1.1),   (from  ), and the   language  .  The original implementation of   was called Eiffel#,  a name retired since the full   language is now supported. The suffix has also been used for  , such as   (a .NET   for   and other   libraries) and   (a wrapper for  ).
 The core syntax of the C# language is similar to that of other C-style languages such as C, C++ and Java, particularly:
 Some notable features of C# that distinguish it from C, C++, and Java where noted, are:
 By design, C# is the programming language that most directly reflects the underlying   (CLI).   Most of its intrinsic types correspond to value-types implemented by the CLI framework. However, the language specification does not state the code generation requirements of the compiler: that is, it does not state that a C# compiler must target a Common Language Runtime, or generate   (CIL), or generate any other specific format. Some C# compilers can also generate machine code like traditional compilers of C++ or  . 
 C# supports strongly, implicitly typed variable declarations with the keyword  ,  and implicitly typed arrays with the keyword   followed by a collection initializer. 
 Its type system is split into two families: Value types, like the built-in numeric types and user-defined structs, which are automatically handed over as copies when used as parameters, and reference types, including arrays, instances of classes, and strings, which only hand over a pointer to the respective object. Due to their special handling of the equality operator, strings will nevertheless behave as if they were values, for all practical purposes. You can even use them as   labels. Where necessary, value types will be   automatically. 
 C# supports a strict  ,  . Statements that take conditions, such as   and  , require an expression of a type that implements the   operator, such as the Boolean type. While C++ also has a Boolean type, it can be freely converted to and from integers, and expressions such as   require only that   is convertible to bool, allowing   to be an int, or a pointer. C# disallows this ""integer meaning true or false"" approach, on the grounds that forcing programmers to use expressions that return exactly   can prevent certain types of programming mistakes such as   (use of assignment   instead of equality  ).
 C# is more   than C++. The only   by default are those that are considered safe, such as widening of integers. This is enforced at compile-time, during  , and, in some cases, at runtime. No implicit conversions occur between Booleans and integers, nor between enumeration members and integers (except for literal 0, which can be implicitly converted to any enumerated type). Any user-defined conversion must be explicitly marked as explicit or implicit, unlike C++   and conversion operators, which are both implicit by default.
 C# has explicit support for   in generic types,  unlike C++ which has some degree of support for contravariance simply through the semantics of return types on virtual methods.
  members are placed in their own  .
 The C# language does not allow for global variables or functions. All methods and members must be declared within classes. Static members of public classes can substitute for global variables and functions.
 Local variables cannot   variables of the enclosing block, unlike C and C++.
  can be achieved in several ways:
 A   in C# is a member of a class that can be invoked as a function (a sequence of instructions), rather than the mere value-holding capability of a   (i.e.   or  ).  As in other syntactically similar languages, such as C++ and  , the signature of a method is a declaration comprising in order: any optional accessibility keywords (such as  ), the explicit specification of its return type (such as  , or the keyword   if no value is returned), the name of the method, and finally, a parenthesized sequence of comma-separated parameter specifications, each consisting of a parameter's type, its formal name and optionally, a default value to be used whenever none is provided. Different from most other languages,   parameters have to be marked both at the function definition  and at the calling site, and you can choose between   and  , the latter allowing handing over an uninitialized variable which will have a definite value on return.  Additionally, you can specify a   by applying the   keyword to the last parameter.  Certain specific kinds of methods, such as those that simply get or set a field's value by returning or assigning it, do not require an explicitly stated full signature, but in the general case, the definition of a class includes the full signature declaration of its methods. 
 Like C++, and unlike Java, C# programmers must use the scope modifier keyword   to allow methods to be   by subclasses. Unlike C++, you have to explicitly specify the keyword   when doing so.  This is supposed to avoid confusion between overriding and newly overloading a function (i.e. hiding the former implementation). To do the latter, you have to specify the   keyword. 
  in C# allow programmers to use static methods as if they were methods from a class's method table, allowing programmers to virtually add instance methods to a class that they feel should exist on that kind of objects (and instances of the respective derived classes). 
 The type   allows for run-time method binding, allowing for JavaScript-like method calls and run-time  .  
 C# has support for strongly-typed   via the keyword  . Like the Qt framework's pseudo-C++   and  , C# has semantics specifically surrounding publish-subscribe style events, though C# uses delegates to do so.
 C# offers Java-like   method calls, via the attribute  , and has support for   via the keyword  .
 C# supports classes with  . The properties can be simple accessor functions with a backing field, or implement arbitrary getter and setter functions. A property is read-only if there's no setter. Like with fields, there can be class and instance properties. The underlying methods can be   or   like any other method. 
 Since C# 3.0 the   of auto-implemented properties is available,  where the   encapsulate operations on a single   of a class.
 A C#   provides the same level of code isolation as a Java   or a C++  , with very similar rules and features to a  . Namespaces can be imported with the ""using"" syntax. 
 In C#, memory address pointers can only be used within blocks specifically marked as  ,  and programs with unsafe code need appropriate permissions to run. Most object access is done through safe object references, which always either point to a ""live"" object or have the well-defined   value; it is impossible to obtain a reference to a ""dead"" object (one that has been garbage collected), or to a random block of memory. An unsafe pointer can point to an instance of an unmanaged value type that does not contain any references to objects subject to garbage collections such as class instances, arrays or strings. Code that is not marked as unsafe can still store and manipulate pointers through the   type, but it cannot dereference them.
 Managed memory cannot be explicitly freed; instead, it is automatically garbage collected. Garbage collection addresses the problem of   by freeing the programmer of responsibility for releasing memory that is no longer needed in most cases. Code that retains references to objects longer than is required can still experience higher memory usage than necessary, however once the final reference to an object is released the memory is available for garbage collection.
 A range of standard exceptions are available to programmers. Methods in standard libraries regularly throw system exceptions in some circumstances and the range of exceptions thrown is normally documented. Custom exception classes can be defined for classes allowing handling to be put in place for particular circumstances as needed. 
  are not present in C# (in contrast to Java). This has been a conscious decision based on the issues of scalability and versionability. 
 Unlike  , C# does not support  , although a class can implement any number of "" "" (fully abstract classes). This was a design decision by the language's lead architect to avoid complications and to simplify architectural requirements throughout CLI.
 When implementing multiple interfaces that contain a method with the same name and taking parameters of the same type in the same order (i.e. the same  ), similar to  , C# allows both a single method to cover all interfaces and if necessary specific methods for each interface.
 However, unlike Java, C# supports  . 
 C# also offers   (a.k.a. ad-hoc-polymorphism). 
 Since version 2.0, C# offers  , i.e. classes with arbitrary or constrained type parameters, e.g.  , a variable-sized array which only can contain elements of type  . There are certain kinds of constraints you can specify for the type parameters: Has to be type X ( ), has to implement a certain interface, has to be a reference type, has to be a value type, has to implement a public parameterless  . Most of them can be combined, and you can specify any number of interfaces. 
 C# has the ability to utilize   through the .NET Framework. A developer can query a variety of data sources, provided the   interface is implemented on the object. This includes XML documents, an   dataset, and SQL databases. 
 Using LINQ in C# brings advantages like   support, strong filtering capabilities, type safety with compile error checking ability, and consistency for querying data over a variety of sources.   There are several different language structures that can be utilized with C# and LINQ and they are query expressions, lambda expressions, anonymous types, implicitly typed variables, extension methods, and object initializers. 
 LINQ has two syntaxes: query syntax and method syntax. However, the compiler always converts the query syntax to method syntax at compile time. 
 Though primarily an imperative language, C# always adds functional features over time,  for example:
 C# has a  . This unified type system is called   (CTS). 
 A unified type system implies that all types, including primitives such as integers, are subclasses of the   class. For example, every type inherits a   method.
 CTS separates data types into two categories: 
 Instances of value types neither have referential identity nor referential comparison semantics. Equality and inequality comparisons for value types compare the actual data values within the instances, unless the corresponding operators are overloaded. Value types are derived from  , always have a default value, and can always be created and copied. Some other limitations on value types are that they cannot derive from each other (but can implement interfaces) and cannot have an explicit default (parameterless) constructor because they already have an implicit one which initializes all contained data to the type-dependent default value (0, null, or alike). Examples of value types are all primitive types, such as   (a signed 32-bit integer),   (a 32-bit IEEE floating-point number),   (a 16-bit Unicode code unit),   (fixed-point numbers useful for handling currency amounts), and   (identifies a specific point in time with nanosecond precision). Other examples are   (enumerations) and   (user defined structures).
 In contrast, reference types have the notion of referential identity, meaning that each instance of a reference type is inherently distinct from every other instance, even if the data within both instances is the same. This is reflected in default equality and inequality comparisons for reference types, which test for referential rather than structural equality, unless the corresponding operators are overloaded (such as the case for  ). Some operations are not always possible, such as creating an instance of a reference type, copying an existing instance, or performing a value comparison on two existing instances. Though specific reference types can provide such services by exposing a public constructor or implementing a corresponding interface (such as   or  ). Examples of reference types are   (the ultimate base class for all other C# classes),   (a string of Unicode characters), and   (a base class for all C# arrays).
 Both type categories are extensible with user-defined types.
  is the operation of converting a value-type object into a value of a corresponding reference type.  Boxing in C# is implicit.
  is the operation of converting a value of a reference type (previously boxed) into a value of a value type.  Unboxing in C# requires an explicit  . A boxed object of type T can only be unboxed to a T (or a nullable T). 
 Example:
 The C# specification details a minimum set of types and class libraries that the compiler expects to have available. In practice, C# is most often used with some implementation of the   (CLI), which is standardized as ECMA-335  .
 In addition to the standard CLI specifications, there are many commercial and community class libraries that build on top of the .NET framework libraries to provide additional functionality. 
 C# can make calls to any library included in the  .
 The following is a very simple C# program, a version of the classic "" "" example using the   feature introduced in C# 9: 
 For code written as C# 8 or lower, the entry point logic of a program must be written in a Main method inside a type:
 This code will display this text in the console window:
 Each line has a purpose:
 The above line imports all types in the   namespace. For example, the   class used later in the source code is defined in the   namespace, meaning it can be used without supplying the full name of the type (which includes the namespace).
 This line is a comment; it describes and documents the code for the programmer(s). 
Above is a   definition for the   class. Everything that follows between the pair of braces describes that class. The curly brackets demarcate the boundaries of a code block. In this first instance, they are marking the start and end of the   class. This declares the class member method where the program begins execution. The .NET runtime calls the   method. Unlike in  , the   method does not need the   keyword, which tells the compiler that the method can be called from anywhere by any class.  Writing   is equivalent to writing  . The   makes the method accessible without an instance of  . Each console application's   entry point must be declared   otherwise the program would require an instance of  , but any instance would require a program. To avoid that irresolvable  , C# compilers processing   (like that above) report an error if there is no   method. The   keyword declares that   has no  . (Note, however, that short programs can be written using   introduced in C# 9, as mentioned earlier.) 
 This line writes the output.   is a static class in the   namespace. It provides an interface to the standard input, output, and error streams for console applications. The program calls the   method  , which displays on the console a line with the argument, the string  .
 With .NET 2.0 and C# 2.0, the community requested more flexible collections than those in .NET 1.x. In the absence of generics, developers had to use collections such as ArrayList to store elements as objects, which incurred performance overhead when boxing/unboxing operations.
 Generics introduced a massive new feature in .NET that allowed developers to create type-safe data structures. This shift is particularly important in the context of converting legacy systems, where updating to generics can significantly enhance performance and maintainability by replacing outdated data structures with more efficient, type-safe alternatives.  
 
  The main advantage of generics is improved type safety. Generics impose compile-time type checking, requiring that only the correct type of data is used with the generic classes or methods.
  Generics perform better because there is no boxing and unboxing involved when working with value types. In non-generic collections such as ArrayList value types are treated as objects meaning they should be boxed (converted out of a value type to an object type) when put into the collection along with unboxed (converted to the value type) when retrieved. This operation is computationally expensive. As generics typically have the type known at compile time, no boxing is required since operations are type-specific and thus much faster.
  Generics make code much easier to reuse. By type parameters, a single generic class, method, interface or delegate might have any number of data types. This enables developers to design a type – independent function or data structure without worrying about overloading methods or creating multiple variants of the same class for different types. This not just makes the codebase easier but also causes it to be simpler to keep less code and also increases applicability.
 
 A Windows   example:
 This example is similar to the previous example, except that it generates a   that contains the message ""Hello, World!"" instead of writing it to the console.
 
Another useful library is the   library, which is used to programmatically draw images. For example: This will create an image that is identical to that stored in ""Image.png"".
 In August 2001,  ,   and   co-sponsored the submission of specifications for C# as well as the   to the standards organization  . In December 2001, ECMA released ECMA-334  . C# became an  /  standard in 2003 (ISO/IEC 23270:2003 -  ). ECMA had previously adopted equivalent specifications as the 2nd edition of C#, in December 2002. In June 2005, ECMA approved edition 3 of the C# specification, and updated ECMA-334. Additions included partial classes, anonymous methods, nullable types, and   (somewhat similar to C++  ). In July 2005, ECMA submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22, via the latter's Fast-Track process, the standards and related TRs. This process usually takes 6–9 months.
 The C# language definition and the   are standardized under  /  and   standards that provide   protection from patent claims.
 Microsoft initially agreed not to sue open-source developers for violating patents in non-profit projects for the part of the framework that is covered by the  .  Microsoft has also agreed not to enforce patents relating to   products against Novell's paying customers  with the exception of a list of products that do not explicitly mention C#, .NET or Novell's implementation of .NET ( ).  However, Novell maintained that Mono does not infringe any Microsoft patents.  Microsoft also made a specific agreement not to enforce patent rights related to the  , which depends on Mono, provided it is obtained through Novell. 
 A decade later, Microsoft began developing free, open-source, and cross-platform tooling for C#, namely  ,  , and  . Mono joined Microsoft as a project of  , a Microsoft subsidiary.
 Microsoft is leading the development of the   reference C# compilers and set of tools. The first compiler,  , compiles into intermediate language (IL), and the second one, RyuJIT,  is a JIT (just-in-time) compiler, which is dynamic and does on-the-fly optimization and compiles the IL into native code for the front-end of the CPU.  RyuJIT is open source and written in C++.  Roslyn is entirely written in   (C#), has been opened up and functionality surfaced as APIs.  It is thus enabling developers to create refactoring and diagnostics tools.  Two branches of official implementation are .NET Framework (closed-source, Windows-only) and .NET Core (open-source, cross-platform); they eventually converged into one open-source implementation: .NET 5.0.  At .NET Framework 4.6, a new JIT compiler replaced the former.

When it comes to comparing two strings concurrently, we can leverage ConcurrentDictionary along with appropriate methods to achieve efficient In .NET Core, the ConcurrentDictionary class provides a thread-safe collection for storing key-value pairs, making it suitable for concurrent operations in multi-threaded environments. When it comes to comparing two strings concurrently, we can leverage ConcurrentDictionary along with appropriate methods to achieve efficient and thread-safe comparison operations. In this article, we'll explore how to use ConcurrentDictionary for comparing two strings concurrently in .NET Core, with the added functionality of reading the strings from the console. Now, let's implement the string comparison using ConcurrentDictionary. Open the Program.cs file in your text editor and update it as follows. In the code user needs to enter the below data. In this article, we explored how to use ConcurrentDictionary to compare two strings concurrently in .NET Core. By leveraging ConcurrentDictionary, along with asynchronous programming techniques, we can efficiently compare strings in a thread-safe manner, making it suitable for multi-threaded scenarios. This approach ensures that string comparison operations are performed concurrently without the risk of data corruption or race conditions, enhancing the performance and scalability of our applications. Additionally, by dynamically inputting the strings from the console, we provide flexibility and interactivity to our users. 😊Please consider liking and following me for more articles and if you find this content helpful.👍 An In-Depth Guide to C# Generics in .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8 with 70+ Code Samples",https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/App_Themes/CSharp/Images/SiteLogo.png|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Images/csharp/ajax-loader-small.gif|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Images/csharp/ajax-loader-small.gif|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Images/csharp/ajax-loader-small.gif|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/MinorCatImages/062632AM.png|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/AuthorImage/cd47be20231010033636.jpg.ashx?width=98&height=98|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/EBooks/01082024095055AM/03132024121935PMCsharp.png|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/AuthorCompanyImage/cd47be20240117033800.png.ashx?height=80&width=80,https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/concurrent-dictionary-for-string-comparison-in-net-core/

www.c-sharpcorner.com,What is the difference between int and int32?,"int is the alias name for int32 in C#   Difference between int and Int32:int is an alias name for Int32. it is short cut to right System.Int32 in c#.
both can be used in your program.   Int16: 2 bytes
Int32 and int: 4 bytes
Int64 : 8 bytes   int is a primitive type allowed by the C# compiler, whereas Int32 is the Framework Class Library type (available across languages that abide by CLS).
in c# we write int and in vb.net we write integer   int32 allows null values where as int doesnt allow null values   int is 64bit and int32 is 32bit   int is a primitive data type in c# .net language
System.Int32 refers the base class of int in c# .net
This System.Int32 is base type for all the .net languages such as integer in vb.net and also other all the .net languages
to find out the base type of a data type we use typeof constant
as like below
Console.WriteLine(typeof(int))
typeof is a constant which will return the base type of the given data type   For the Declaration Purpose we used int like int i = 1; but for the conversion purpose we have to use Convert.Int32(); Function because int32 is CTS function.   ""int"" is a data type keyword defined by the language, C#.
Int32 is a data type defined by the .NET Common Type System (CTS).   System is a base class for int32.int i=10;from the above instead of ""int"" i can write ""system.int32"" where system is a pre defined class.",https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/App_Themes/CSharp/Images/SiteLogo.png|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Images/csharp/ajax-loader-small.gif|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Images/csharp/ajax-loader-small.gif|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Images/csharp/ajax-loader-small.gif|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/authorimage/defaultauthorimage.jpg.ashx?width=80&height=80|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/authorimage/defaultauthorimage.jpg.ashx?width=62&height=62|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/AuthorImage/23001720171111021610.jpg.ashx?width=62&height=62|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/AuthorImage/1b57e220180131042027.jpg.ashx?width=62&height=62|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/AuthorImage/7181ac20210626082849.png.ashx?width=62&height=62|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/authorimage/defaultauthorimage.jpg.ashx?width=62&height=62|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/authorimage/defaultauthorimage.jpg.ashx?width=62&height=62|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/AuthorImage/edfc7e20170910030726.png.ashx?width=62&height=62|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/AuthorImage/13760520150126084053.jpg.ashx?width=62&height=62|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/authorimage/defaultauthorimage.jpg.ashx?width=62&height=62|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/AuthorImage/0bab9920161221075515.jpg.ashx?width=62&height=62|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/authorimage/defaultauthorimage.jpg|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/authorimage/defaultauthorimage.jpg,https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/interview-question/what-is-the-difference-between-int-and-int

www.c-sharpcorner.com,"What is difference between $(document).ready(function(){ vs $(function(){ ?
","What is difference between  $(document).ready(function(){ }); vs $(function(){  });   This uses the j-query library to detect when the DOM is ready for JavaScript to execute. Specifically, you are passing in the document object as an argument to the j-query constructor and calling the ready() function on it, which will wait until the ready event fires.
 This is an anonymous function that instantaneously runs. The difference is that if you were to put these two lines next to each, whether both will run will depend on where the page state is. Once your code reaches the anonymous function it will run it regardless. Once it hits the j-query snippet, if your page is still loading dependencies, etc. and the ready event isn’t fired then your code in the curly braces will not run until it is.
  $(document).ready() is JQuery's ready event handler the function you pass to the ready method is added to the queue of functions that are to be invoked once the document is loaded$(function) is an immediately invoked function Expressions. This function will be invoked as soon as the browser has parsed it, which may or may not be before the document has finished loading    Is a Shorthand version of: So technically they are both the  .   $(function(){ }); is the shortest version of $(document).ready(function(){})
  Not major difference between these two declaration. They used based on weather you use JavaScript then you should use $(document).ready declaration in other case you use jQuery library which is a part of JavaScript then you should use $(function) declaration.",https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/App_Themes/CSharp/Images/SiteLogo.png|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Images/csharp/ajax-loader-small.gif|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Images/csharp/ajax-loader-small.gif|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Images/csharp/ajax-loader-small.gif|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/AuthorImage/2f59d020151120081054.bmp|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/AuthorImage/6c290120200102124006.jpg.ashx?width=62&height=62|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/AuthorImage/6bc78520190823024209.jpg.ashx?width=62&height=62|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/AuthorImage/8c19e820200526062819.jpg.ashx?width=62&height=62|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/AuthorImage/fcfb2720190824083427.jpg.ashx?width=62&height=62|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/AuthorImage/a765b620191112101225.png.ashx?width=62&height=62|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/AuthorImage/2f59d020151120081054.bmp|https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/AuthorImage/2f59d020151120081054.bmp,https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/interview-question/what-is-difference-between-documentreadyfunction-vs-function

en.wikipedia.org,Xbox Series X and Series S - Wikipedia,"The   and   are the fourth generation of   in the  . Released on November 10, 2020, the higher-end Xbox Series X and lower-end Xbox Series S are part of the  , which also includes  's  , released the same month.  Both superseded the  .
 In early 2019, rumors emerged of a fourth generation of Xbox consoles (codenamed ""Scarlett"") that consisted of a high-end model (""Anaconda"") and a lower-end model (""Lockhart""). Microsoft teased Anaconda in June 2019 during   and unveiled it as the Xbox Series X during   in December. On September 8, 2020, Microsoft unveiled the Xbox Series S. A slimmed version of the Xbox Series X has been leaked which lacks a disk drive and is rumored to release in November 2024. 
 Like the Xbox One, the consoles use an   64-bit     and  . Both models have   to reduce loading times, support for hardware-accelerated   and  , the ability to convert games to   using   (Auto HDR), support for     and low-latency modes, and updated  . Xbox Series X was designed to nominally render games in 2160p ( ) at 60   (FPS). The lower-end, digital-only Xbox Series S, which has reduced specifications and does not include an optical drive, was designed to nominally render games in   at 60 FPS, with support for 4K   and ray tracing. 
 Xbox Series X/S are   with nearly all Xbox One-compatible games and accessories (including   and   games that were  ); the newer hardware gives games better performance and visuals. At launch, Microsoft encouraged a ""soft"" transition between generations, similar to  , offering the ""Smart Delivery"" framework to allow publishers to provide upgraded versions of Xbox One titles with optimizations for Xbox Series X/S. Publishers are not required to use Smart Delivery and may publish Xbox Series X/S-exclusive titles if they choose.   is among the developers that do not use Smart Delivery.
 Critics praised the Xbox Series X/S for the hardware improvements over Xbox One and Microsoft's emphasis on cross-generation releases, but believed that the games available at launch did not fully use the hardware capabilities. In June 2023, during an ID@Xbox presentation at the Best International Games (BIG) Festival in Brazil, Microsoft revealed that over 21 million Xbox Series consoles have been sold worldwide. 
 Industry rumors of new Xbox hardware had started as early as June 2018, with Microsoft's   confirming they were ""deep into architecturing the next Xbox consoles"" at that time.  The hardware was believed to be a family of devices under the codename ""Scarlett"", including a low-cost version following a similar scheme as the   family of consoles, with major emphasis on game streaming and  .  By March 2019, further industry rumors had led to speculation of two consoles within the Scarlett family under codenames ""Anaconda"" and the low-cost ""Lockhart"" version. 
 Microsoft confirmed   at its   press conference.  Microsoft said they wanted a ""soft"" transition from Xbox One to Scarlett, with Scarlett supporting backward compatibility with all games and most hardware supported on the Xbox One.  During a presentation at  , Microsoft officially revealed the design of Scarlett and its branding, ""Xbox Series X"", as well as a late 2020 release date.  After the event, a Microsoft spokesperson said Xbox Series X was a fourth generation of Xbox hardware, which will be branded simply ""Xbox"" with no subtitle. 
 Microsoft planned to detail the hardware specifications and launch games for the Series X at the 2020   (GDC) and  , but the events were cancelled due to the  . Microsoft scheduled online presentations over the same days in March 2020,  while the company planned to reschedule its E3 presentation.  Detailed specifications were presented by Microsoft,  , and   of Overclock Media on March 16, 2020.  Starting in May and running until launch, Microsoft planned to have more digital events around the Xbox Series X and its games as part of an ""Xbox 20/20"" series.  This included an Xbox Games Showcase on July 23, 2020, featuring games principally from its first-party  . 
 On July 16, 2020, Microsoft announced that it had ended production of the Xbox One X and all-digital version of the Xbox One S in preparation for the new products. 
 The existence of the Xbox Series S had been guessed before E3 2019, based on a ""Project Lockhart"", a second, lower-end console that accompanied Scarlett.  Confirmation of the Xbox Series S naming was affirmed through early Xbox hardware accessories that some had been able to purchase.  Microsoft officially announced the Series S console on September 8, 2020, revealing that it would also be released alongside the Series X in November 2020.  Microsoft pointed out that the Series S had been discreetly placed in the background of previous Xbox announcement videos featuring Phil Spencer during July 2020. 
 During   2023, Spencer stated that Microsoft is not likely to produce a mid-generation revision of either the Series X or Series S, as it would likely cause issues with specifications for games between the first such units and mid-generation ones. Instead, he said that ""that when we do hardware, it should have a reason to exist that is demonstrably different than what came before"", and that likely their next hardware would be for the future tenth generation of consoles. 
 When Microsoft's Xbox development team started work on the successor to the Xbox One consoles around 2016, they had already envisioned the need to have two console versions similar to their Xbox One X and Xbox One S models to meet the needs of different markets. By developing both units in concert, they would be able to make sure games developed would be able to be played on both systems without exception. As has been tradition with past Xbox projects, the consoles were given code names based on cities.  The Xbox Series S was named Project Lockhart, based on the city of  , which Aaron Greenberg said was known as ""the little city with the big heart"". 
 For the high-end console, the Xbox Series X, Microsoft's primary goals were to: at least double the graphical performance of the   as measured by its   (FLOPS), and to increase CPU performance four-fold compared to Xbox One X while maintaining the same acoustic performance from the Xbox One consoles.  As the engineers collected power requirements to meet these specifications, they saw these parts would draw a large amount of internal power (approximately 315  ) and would generate a significant amount of heat. 
 This led to the decision to split the components onto two separate  ; one would house the CPU/GPU, memory, and power regulators, and a second board would act as a   board for slower   (I/O) functions. The boards mounted on opposite sides of an aluminum chassis helped to create air channels for cooling. The remaining components—the  , the  , the  , the  , and the  —were then arranged in a  -like fashion, according to principal designer Chris Kujawski, to achieve a compact form factor, resulting in the tower-like structure.  To meet the acoustics factor, the system includes numerous sensors for controlling the speed of the fan, and the large open top was necessary to ensure good airflow through the system.  While certain elements like the optical drive, air flow requirements, and heat sink size fixed certain dimensions in the overall form factor, they were satisfied they were able to end up with a square footprint for the unit. 
 Xbox head Phil Spencer said that Microsoft was prioritizing high frame rates and faster load times over higher resolutions; the Series X achieves this via the better-matched capabilities of the CPU and  .  Compared to the Xbox One X, the CPU is about four times as powerful and the GPU is twice as powerful. 
 The Xbox Series X is powered by a custom 7 nm     CPU with eight cores running at a nominal 3.8 GHz or, when   (SMT) is used, at 3.6 GHz. One CPU core is dedicated to the underlying operating system.  The integrated GPU is also a custom unit based on AMD's   graphics architecture. It has a total of 56 compute units (CUs) with 3,584 cores, with 52 CUs and 3,328 cores enabled, and will run at a fixed 1.825 GHz. This unit is capable of 12   of computational power.  The unit ships with 16 GB of  , with 10 GB running at 560 GB/s primarily to be used with the graphics system and the other 6 GB at 336 GB/s to be used for the other computing functions. After accounting for the system software, about 13.5 GB of memory will be available for games and other applications, with the system software only drawing from the slower pool.  The Xbox Series X is intended to render games at   at 60 frames per second, and can support up to 120 frames per second and can render up to  . 
 The Xbox Series X's console form is designed to be unobtrusive and minimalistic. It has a 15.1 cm × 15.1 cm (5.9 in × 5.9 in) footprint, is 30.1 cm (11.9 in) high, and weighs 4.45 kg (9.8 lb).  Designed to sit vertically, it can also be used on its side. Its front has the main power button and an   drive.  The top of the unit is a single powerful fan. Spencer said that the console is as quiet as the Xbox One X.  The Series X includes an HDMI 2.1 output, the storage expansion slot, three   ports, and an  .  The console does not include an infrared blaster or HDMI pass-through like the Xbox One line, supporting   instead. An earlier leak had suggested a   port for digital audio, but this was eliminated in the final design.  The console has an IR receiver in its controller pairing button next to the front USB port. 
 The Xbox Series S is comparable in its hardware to the Xbox Series X, similar to how the Xbox One S relates to the Xbox One X, but has less processing power. While it runs the same CPU with slightly slower clock frequencies, it uses a slower GPU, a custom RDNA2 with 20 CUs at 1.55 GHz for 4 TFLOPS, compared to 12 TFLOPS of the Series X. It ships with 10 GB of RAM, with 8 GB running at 224 GB/s primarily to be used with the graphics system and the other 2 GB at 56 GB/s to be used for the other computing functions, and a 512 GB SSD storage unit with a raw input/output throughput of 2.4 GB/s.  It does not include an optical drive, so all games and software must be obtained   via  . It is intended to render games nominally at  , with support for a 4K  , at 60 frames per second, although it can go as high at 120 frames per second at this resolution. It starts at $299.99.  Selected games can support native 4K resolution output on the Series S, such as  .  Otherwise, the console has the same functions as the Xbox Series X, including ports, expansions, and game support. 
 Microsoft designed the Series S to easily fit inside of a small bag or backpack for portability and travel usage.  The Series S unit is about 60% smaller by volume than the Series X, measuring 275 by 151 by 63.5 millimetres (10.83 in × 5.94 in × 2.50 in) in its vertical orientation. In this orientation, its large side surface features the major exhaust port for active air cooling, similar to the top surface of the Series X; additional vents are then located on the top of the Series S. Like the Series X, the front of the Series S features one USB port and a controller pairing button with an integrated IR receiver. The rear of the console includes the power connector, one HDMI port, two additional USB ports, and an Ethernet port. Like the Series X, the Series S can also be placed horizontally with the exhaust port facing upward to maintain airflow. The Series S launched in a matte white case along with a matching controller, distinguishing it from the matte black that the Series X uses. 
 Both consoles use a new storage solution, the Xbox Velocity Architecture, that includes hardware and software components to improve transfer speeds within the console, reduce the size of digital downloads, and give developers more flexibility.  Central to this is the internal storage, a custom   (NVMe)  . On the Series X, this is a 1 TB SSD (802 GB available)  with a raw input/output throughput of 2.4 GB/s. An on-board compression/decompression block includes both the industry standard   decompression algorithm and a proprietary BCPack algorithm geared for  , and it gives a combined throughput as high as 4.8 GB/s.  Within the software, a new DirectStorage   within   allows developers to fine-tune priority to input/output aspects with other processing threads. The software provides sampler feedback streaming that aids in loading multiple textures in segments to deal with   rendering, rather than having to read these textures as a whole before using them.  The Series S includes a 512 GB SSD (364 GB available)  with similar custom hardware and software specifications.  All SSD storage on the architecture use a   x2 link. 
 Developers at   found that, without any changes to their code,   loaded four times faster on Xbox Series X than Xbox One X due to the higher throughput on memory and storage and that they would be able to increase this further once they incorporated the new DirectStorage API routines. 
 The consoles support external storage through a proprietary SSD   inserted into the back of the console, which was manufactured exclusively by   on launch and limited to a 1 TB size when first released.  Later versions included 512 GB and 2 TB versions and were released at the end of 2021,  while expansion cards manufactured by   were released in June 2023.  As with the Xbox One, the consoles will also support external USB storage, but only   (which can also be transferred directly from an Xbox One console) will be able to run directly from external USB storage. Xbox Series X- and S-native games must be stored on the internal SSD or an expansion card in order to be played, but they can be moved to a USB storage device to make room for other games. 
 The DirectStorage API was released in March 2022 for Windows-based computers for   that support DirectX 12 and NVMe SSDs, though games must be programmed to take advantage of the DirectStorage API.  DirectStorage was planned to be a built-in feature along with Auto HDR for   at release in late 2021,  as well as offered within Windows 10. 
 Both the Series X and Series S support real-time   and support the new features of the   standard including   (VRR) and Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) that are currently being incorporated into newer televisions.  The console will have dedicated audio hardware acceleration.  A feature called ""audio ray tracing"" will use the graphics ray tracing processors to process spatial audio in the same manner to improve the audio immersion for the player. 
 Another goal for Microsoft was to reduce the effects of input latency to improve responsiveness, adding support for HDMI 2.1 Auto Low Latency Mode and Variable Refresh Rate features, and ""dynamic latency input"" technology—a new input pathway that allows developers to incorporate potential controller lag into their games. 
 AMD's  , an image upscaling technology competitor to  's   (DLSS) to enable higher resolutions and framerates, was added to the Xbox Series X/S in June 2021. 
 Both consoles support   and   technologies.  Dolby Vision was initially limited to streaming apps at launch, but was released for games in September 2021. 
 The following table is a comparison of the major components of the fourth generation of Xbox consoles. 
 The Series X and Series S ship with an updated version of the   intended to fit a larger range of hand sizes. They include same key buttons as the past controllers: two analog joysticks that can be depressed, a  , four action buttons, two system buttons (""View"" and ""Menu""), the main Xbox home button, two grip triggers (left and right), and two shoulder buttons (left and right). The new controller adds a ""Share"" button alongside the ""View"" and ""Menu"" buttons; pressing ""Share"" once takes a screenshot, while holding the button begins a Game DVR recording. 
 Microsoft found that by aiming the size to fit an eight-year-old's hands, they were able to make the design fit a larger section of the population; it thus features more sculpted grips, and has reduced and rounded trigger buttons.  The D-pad is a new concave design that senior console designer Ryan Whitaker said was a means to merge the normal D-pad style on the standard Xbox One controller and the version on the Elite variant to accommodate a range of playstyles.  Small tactile dot patterns have been added to the buttons to help players orient fingers on the controls.  The controller continues to use two  , though a rechargeable battery pack is available as an accessory. Microsoft found from focus group studies that players were split nearly 50/50 on the use of batteries versus recharging and thus gave the controller the option to use either. 
 The controller uses the same wireless protocol introduced by the Xbox One and is backward compatible with existing Xbox One consoles. Existing Xbox One controllers are also compatible with Xbox Series X.  The new controller also supports the   standard allowing it to pair with mobile devices and other hardware supporting that standard, and has internal storage to remember those connections.  It uses a   connector for wired use and charging (with the optional battery kit) rather than  . 
 Many of the first-party accessories designed to work with the preceding Xbox One remain compatible with the Xbox Series X, including the Xbox Stereo Headset and Xbox Wireless Headset. 
 Spencer said that the Xbox Series X will likely not have immediate   (VR) support at launch, and that they expect that any VR support will be based on the   components contained within the console's   components, but was otherwise not a focus of the console's development prior to release. 
 An updated Xbox Series S with a matte black finish and 1 TB of storage launched on September 1, 2023; the internal design remains otherwise unchanged. 
 Unrelated court documents from the 2022 court case   include plans for refreshed mid-generation consoles scheduled to be released in 2024. The updated Xbox Series X, codenamed ""Brooklin"", would feature a cylindrical design that drops the optical drive, draws less power, increases internal storage to 2 TB, and improves wireless connectivity with  . The updated Xbox Series S, codenamed ""Ellewood"", would retain the same design as the current Series S, reducing power consumption and adding Wi-Fi 6E and 1 TB of internal storage. Both console refreshes are planned to ship with a new Xbox controller, codenamed ""Sebile"".  The new controller will be named the Xbox Universal Controller and will include a rechargeable, swappable battery. 
 Both consoles have a similar   (UI) as the Xbox One, but use 40% less memory to improve its speed. According to the UI development team, the Home section loads in about half the time as it did on the Xbox One. Other changes include adding rounded UI elements, a more-readable font for text elements, rearrangement of certain aligned features, and improvements to the sharing functions. These changes were brought to the Xbox One system software, the Windows' Xbox application, and the Xbox mobile application around September 2020.  Based on system previews, about 200 GB of space was reserved on the internal drive of the Xbox Series X for system files. 
 Xbox Series S and Series X support ""Quick Resume"", which allows users to suspend and resume up to three games at once. Games can also be resumed after a reboot of the console.  The March 2022 update added the ability to ""pin"" up to two games to Quick Resume, keeping them suspended unless otherwise closed manually, or the game must be updated. 
 As with previous Xbox consoles, Xbox Series S and Series X use the   platform for online services. It supports the   service, which allows subscribers to download games from an on-demand library.  In October 2021,  —a component of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate which allows users to   games from Microsoft servers to Xbox consoles, PCs, and  —was upgraded from Xbox One S-based hardware to Xbox Series X-based servers, enabling faster server-side loading times. 
 Apps for various   are available via Microsoft Store. The   was released on Xbox platforms for the first time alongside the Xbox Series S and Series X. 
 Microsoft allows all retail Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles to use an environment known as 'Dev mode', which provides developers with a sandbox environment to test their games and applications. 
 At launch of the Xbox Series X/S, Microsoft positioned new games to be available for both the Xbox One and the new consoles.   head Matt Booty said that Microsoft wanted to ensure that those who had recently bought Xbox One consoles would still ""feel that they made a good investment and that we're committed to them with content.""  Spencer said many of the Xbox Game Studios subsidiaries were familiar with developing games on personal computers, where there is a wide range of hardware targets to meet. This approach allows the creation of games that perform well on the Xbox One consoles yet take advantage of the new hardware with higher graphics   and faster  ,  , and support for the consoles' storage architecture. 
 For some games, further game improvements from the Xbox One version to Xbox Series X/S version can be made with the capabilities of the Xbox Series X/S console; games with this support are marketed with an ""Optimized for Series X"" logo.  Microsoft offered a distribution framework known as ""Smart Delivery"" that will automatically download Xbox Series X/S versions of backwards compatible games for the console when available; Microsoft has positioned this feature at publishers who plan to release Series X- or Series S-specific versions of games after releasing on Xbox One and to users moving from an existing Xbox One to an Xbox Series console. 
 Microsoft does not bar developers from releasing games that can only be played on Xbox Series X/S,  but the company has preferred a ""soft"" transition more in line with  , where developers can target optimal play on higher-end hardware, but still allow the game to be played with reduced fidelity on lower-end hardware (such as older Xbox One consoles). 
 Initially, Spencer suggested that their first-party studios' games would support both Xbox One and Xbox Series X platforms for the ""next couple of years"",  but journalists observed that some of the first-party games introduced in the Xbox Game Showcase in July 2020 omitted mention of the Xbox One, and their websites later updated to omit mention of the Xbox One. While none of these games were believed to be launch titles, they were expected to be released within the window Spencer had previously suggested. This led to Aaron Greenberg, general manager of Xbox Games Marketing, to clarify that these games were being developed for the Xbox Series X first, leaving the choice of adding Xbox One support to their development studios as they went forward.  In June 2023, Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty stated that its in-house studios had ""moved on to Gen 9"" and were no longer working on new games targeting Xbox One. 
 Microsoft has not placed any similar requirements on a soft transition for third-party developers and publishers, allowing them to offer Xbox Series X exclusives or other routes to upgrade from the Xbox One edition of a game, though   reported that Microsoft had urged publishers to keep the upgrade path free if they took that option.    RED and   have committed to using Smart Delivery for their upcoming releases.    affirmed that   will have a free update patch from the Xbox One version to the Xbox Series X version prior to the release of the next   game. 
 The Xbox Game Preview program, which allows games to be released through an   model, continued into the Xbox Series X/S line with   in January 2021. 
 Microsoft stated that the Xbox Series X and Series S would support all existing games playable on   (excluding those that require the   sensor),  including   and   games currently supported through  , thus allowing the new consoles to support four generations of games. 
To achieve this level of compatibility, Microsoft announced in June 2019 that they would no longer be bringing any additional Xbox 360 or original Xbox games into the Xbox One backward compatibility program, and they would instead be using their manpower to make sure these older games were playable on the Xbox Series X.  Backward compatibility is a launch feature, with Microsoft having put more than 500,000 man-hours in validating thousands of games from the supported Xbox One library;  Spencer said in December 2019 that he himself had been helping to test backward compatibility games.  As Microsoft neared launch, they reopened the means for players to suggest additional games to add to backward compatibility, stating ""Resurrecting titles from history often presents a complex mix of technical and licensing challenges, but the team is committed to doing everything we can to continue to preserve our collective gaming legacy."" 
 It is possible for advanced graphic processes options not originally programmed into these older games to be worked into the game when played on the console, such as automated   (HDR) support using  , framerate doubling, 16x  , and resolution upscale.  Work done by the Xbox Advanced Technology Group prior to launch was focused on how far into the backward-compatibility library they could take these improvements, including into original Xbox games, adding in features like HDR or improving the framerate of games that may have been programmed to be locked at a specific framerate.  Backward compatible games are supported under the Quick Resume feature as well.  Cloud saves can be used to migrate from Xbox One, and Microsoft stated that it would also add free cloud saves to the Xbox 360 so it can be migrated to a Series S/X console as well. 
 
Xbox Series S can play Xbox One games with improved performance,  , and auto HDR support, but it does not support Xbox One X-specific enhancements.  Microsoft is providing tools for developers to check the performance of their Xbox One games on the Series X and S consoles, which can suggest optimizations ""as easy as changing three lines of code"" to support the improvements in backward compatibility.  In February 2021, Microsoft introduced FPS Boost, a feature for select backward-compatible games that the company said can improve the framerate of these titles on the Xbox Series X and Series S by two to four times. This is a feature that Microsoft's engineers must prepare for each game, with five games supported initially and more to be rolled out over time.  Microsoft developed FPS Boost after finding that for many backward compatible games, the CPU and GPU on the newer consoles frequently entered their idle states even with the other enhancements in place, and so they sought ways to use the unused processing cycles to further enhance the older games' performance.  As of May 2021, about 97 games were updated to support FPS Boost. 
 In March 2021, Microsoft started testing the Auto HDR feature with Windows-compatible games and computers that meet minimal requirements supported through DirectX. 
 In March 2020, Microsoft stated that despite the  , they expected the Xbox Series X to ship by the end of 2020, though they were monitoring supply chains and the safety of their workers.  Then, Spencer believed that while the hardware will continue to ship on time, games poised for the release window of Xbox Series X may be delayed due to the pandemic.  By August 2020, Microsoft committed to a November 2020 release window for the Xbox Series X, affirming the console's release was still on track. 
 Both the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles launched on November 10, 2020,  with the Series X priced at  ,  , and   and the Series S priced at  ,  , and  .  In China, the systems would release on June 10, 2021.  Microsoft affirmed that 31 games would be available at launch, including those from its Xbox Game Studios and from other third-party publishers, in addition to those from its Xbox One backwards compatibility.  While   had been planned as a launch title when the Series X console was first revealed, Microsoft and   opted to delay its release until after the console's launch due to production issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Microsoft will continue its   financing plans (which bundle the hardware, Xbox Live Gold, and Xbox Game Pass as part of a monthly payment plan) for the Series X. Current All Access plans with the Xbox One will include routes to upgrade to the Xbox Series X, and Spencer states that there will be similar upgrades from the Xbox Series X in the future.  The All-Access option for the Xbox Series X option will be based on a 24-month plan at   while the Series S will be based on a   plan. 
 Upon reveal of the Xbox Series X's vertical form factor, a popular Internet   compared the design to a mini  . In the lead-up to the console's release, Microsoft manufactured a limited number of refrigerators modeled after the Xbox Series X exterior, complete with a disk drive handle, green interior  , and the Xbox startup sound. Some were distributed to celebrities like   and  , and others were offered as part of promotional contests.  In March 2021, in collaboration with Microsoft,   offered smaller mini-fridges modeled off the Xbox Series X to promote his line of Zoa energy drinks; Microsoft's Greenberg stated that this was a trial run to see if the Xbox mini-fridge would have potential sales options beyond this promotion.  After followers of the official Xbox Twitter account helped the brand to win in a Twitter marketing vote-based championship in April 2021, Greenberg affirmed that Microsoft will proceed with producing Xbox Series X mini-fridges for purchase.  Microsoft announced during   that these mini fridges would be available to purchase by end-of-year holiday period in 2021.  Microsoft opened pre-orders for the mini-fridge in October 2021, with plans for distribution in December 2021 in North America and European markets. 
 Microsoft announced a 1 TB Xbox Series S model in carbon black, which was released on September 1, 2023 at a price of US$349. 
 At launch, critics praised the new console hardware and commented positively on its improved graphics, reduction of loading times, and strong backward compatibility support, but, due to the lack of any console exclusives, remained hesitant of the console's true power. Because of this, at launch, many did not feel these consoles truly represented the next generation of home consoles. The lack of significant launch-day exclusive titles designed to show off the new hardware capabilities, as well as the familiar controller shape and user interface, was considered by some to be disappointing given the next-generation focus of Sony's PlayStation 5. The Series X was generally considered the better unit when compared to the Series S, as the computation and space limitations of the latter made it a less user-friendly experience to navigate but still otherwise functional.   's Richard Leadbetter stated ""I love the hardware in terms of what I can potentially experience with it and the expert implementation of many of its forward-looking features—but a console is defined by its games, and in that sense, I still feel that I barely know the machine at all.""  Keza MacDonald of   said that while there is no immediate driving force to buy the consoles at launch, ""there's not much to criticise: they do everything they promised to do, and they do it well.""    Kris Graft and Chris Kerr said that ""Microsoft has delivered two highly appealing entry points that can turn players into long-term customers, while at the same time erasing the idea of 'generations,' exposing people to more games, past, present and future."" 
 In November 2021, Jordan Ramée of   acknowledged that Xbox Series X and S had begun to see higher-profile console-exclusive releases since their launch (such as  , and the third-party titles   and  ), and that Smart Delivery was a ""crucial"" feature of the consoles—praising the system for being seamless and automatic unlike PlayStation 5, whose user interface ""did not make it abundantly clear which version of a game you were choosing to download and play, occasionally resulting in players accidentally putting the PS4 version of a game on their PS5."" He also felt that migrating from an older Xbox One was easier than migrating from PS4 to PS5, citing Smart Delivery, automatic synchronization of save data, and maintaining the same user interface. 
 Microsoft announced that the Xbox Series X/S was the biggest Xbox console launch, with more consoles sold in more countries in its first 24 hours than any previous Xbox. The record was previously held by the Xbox One, which sold more than one million units at launch.  The Xbox Series S has attracted a higher percentage of new Xbox players than any previous Microsoft consoles.  Microsoft's CEO,  , would affirm in an earnings call on July 27, 2021, that the Series X and S consoles were the fastest selling Xbox consoles ever.  Microsoft has not revealed the exact sales numbers of the Xbox Series X/S, having last revealed sales figure for Xbox consoles in 2014. However, estimates from industry analysts and exact sales from specific regions are available.
 Daniel Ahmed, a Niko Partners analyst, has provided estimates for the worldwide sell-through of the Xbox Series X/S. The combined worldwide sales of the Xbox Series X and Series S would have reached 3.5 million by December 31, 2020.  Sales would increase to 6.5 million by June 30, 2021, outpacing the 5.7 million units sold of the Xbox One and the 5 million units of the Xbox 360 in the same timeframe.  Sales worldwide are estimated to have reached 8 million by September 30, 2021,  and 12 million units by the end of 2021.  At the end of 2022, it was estimated by Ampere Analysis that sales had reached 18.5 million.  In June 2023, during an ID@Xbox presentation in Brazil, Microsoft revealed that Xbox Series X and Series S had sold over 21 million units to date,  which is lagging behind its rival PS5 with 40 million units sold as of July 2023.  
During the hearing of   on June 22, 2023, Microsoft admitted that they ""lost the console wars"" and ""Xbox's console has consistently ranked third (of three) behind PlayStation and Nintendo in sales. In 2021, Xbox had a market share of 16%...Likewise for console revenues and share of consoles currently in use by gamers ('installed base'), Xbox trails with 21%"" 
 Certified sales data are available in certain regions through providers, such as GfK in various regions of Europe.   also provides specific sales estimates in Japan. In the UK, 155,000 units were sold on launch day, two-thirds of which were Xbox Series X consoles.  Sales in the region would reach 310,000 by the end of 2020,  over 1 million by the end of 2021,  and 1.8 million by the end of 2022.  The Series X variety accounted for 43% of all the Xbox Series consoles sold over 2021 in the UK.  In Japan, 16,247 Xbox Series X and 4,287 Xbox Series S systems were sold during the launch week, for a total of 20,534 units sold.  Sales in Japan would cross 116,000 in November 2021, outselling the lifetime Japanese sales of the Xbox One in under a year.  By the end of 2022, Xbox Series X/S reached 400,000 units sold in Japan.  In Spain, there were 10,500 Xbox Series X and 3,600 Xbox Series S systems sold during the launch week for a combined total of 14,100 units sold.  By the end of 2020, 30,850 Xbox Series X and S systems had been sold in Spain.  96,000 units were sold in Spain in 2022. 
 The   prevented Microsoft from producing enough Xbox consoles to meet demand.  Upon launch, both models almost immediately sold out across all retailers and in all markets.  This led to scalping on Internet marketplace sites, with consoles going for as high as  .  Spencer said that they had gotten a later start on manufacturing the console in mid-2020 as they were waiting for key AMD chip technology, and they had reached full production capacity by launch but were still rushing to meet sales demand, as well as having made projections on proportions of Series X versus Series S sales.  In November 2020, Xbox chief financial officer Tim Stuart said shortages were likely to end in the second quarter of 2021.  Starting in May 2021, Microsoft allowed members of the Xbox Insiders program to sign up for a priority list to purchase an Xbox Series X or Series S directly from Microsoft, though only a limited number of units were offered through this program.  Although Microsoft was unable to produce enough units to satisfy demand during 2021, the revenue from consoles increased because the consoles had higher prices. 
 Microsoft has urged developers to develop games to release on both the Series X and Series S with feature-to-feature parity, despite the latter's limitations. In March 2023,  , the developer of the game  , said that the system with the lowest specs (the Xbox Series S) dictates the features used because games have to be able run on the hardware and that optimization is nowhere near as simple as lowering resolution and texture quality.  Spencer said that split-screen co-op is one area that certain games, such as  , cannot be used as the Series S, and thus has limited their own first-party releases. 
 , the developers of  , did not officially announce a Xbox Series X/S version due to technical issues relating to   on the Xbox Series S. This led to a rumor that the game was a    . Larian Studios denied the console exclusivity and said that   might get released on Xbox should the problems get fixed.  Larian discussed the matter with Spencer, and in August 2023, the studio said it would release   for the Xbox Series X and Series S without the split-screen co-op feature.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Xbox_Series_X_S_color.svg/220px-Xbox_Series_X_S_color.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Xbox_Series_X_2.jpg/111px-Xbox_Series_X_2.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Xbox_Series_S_with_controller.jpg/130px-Xbox_Series_S_with_controller.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Xbox_Series_X_logo.svg/170px-Xbox_Series_X_logo.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Xbox_Series_S.png/170px-Xbox_Series_S.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Xbox_Velocity_Architecture_logo.svg/220px-Xbox_Velocity_Architecture_logo.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Xbox_Wireless_Controller%2C_Model_1914_%27Shock_Blue%27.jpg/220px-Xbox_Wireless_Controller%2C_Model_1914_%27Shock_Blue%27.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5a/Optimized_for_Xbox_Series_X_branding.svg/138px-Optimized_for_Xbox_Series_X_branding.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Xbox_Smart_Delivery_Black.svg/138px-Xbox_Smart_Delivery_Black.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Nuvola_apps_ksim.png/19px-Nuvola_apps_ksim.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e0/WPVG_icon_2016.svg/19px-WPVG_icon_2016.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S

en.wikipedia.org,1992 Angolan general election - Wikipedia,"General elections were held in   on 29 and 30 September 1992 to elect a   and  , the first time free and multi-party elections had been held in the country. They followed the signing of the   on 31 May 1991 in an attempt to end the 17-year-long  .  Voter turnout was 91.3% for the parliamentary election and 91.2% for the presidential election. 
 The ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( ) won both elections; however eight opposition parties, in particular the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( ), rejected the results as rigged. An official observer wrote that there was little UN supervision, that 500,000 UNITA voters were disenfranchised and that there were 100 clandestine polling stations.  UNITA sent negotiators to the capital, but at the same time prepared measures to resume the civil war. As a consequence, hostilities erupted in Luanda and immediately spread to other parts of the country. Several thousand to tens of thousands of UNITA members or supporters were killed nationwide by MPLA forces in a few days, in what is known as the  .
 Angola was a colony of   for more than 400 years from the 15th century. Demands for independence picked up momentum during the early 1950s, with  the principal protagonists including the MPLA, founded in 1956, the   (FNLA), which appeared in 1961, and the UNITA, founded in 1966. After many years of conflict that weakened all of the insurgent parties, Angola gained independence on 11 November 1975, after the   in Portugal, which overthrew the Portuguese regime headed by  . 
 A fight for dominance broke out immediately between the three nationalist movements. The events prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens, creating up to 300,000 destitute Portuguese  —the  .  The new Portuguese government attempted to mediate an understanding between the three competing movements, which they initially agreed to, but later failed and resulted in a devastating civil war which lasted several decades, claiming millions of lives and producing many refugees until ending in 2002. 
 During the civil war, the MPLA gained control of the capital   and much of the rest of the country. With the support of the United States,   and South Africa intervened militarily in favour of the FNLA and UNITA, with the intention of taking Luanda before the declaration of independence.  In response, Cuba intervened in favour of the MPLA, which became a flash point for the  . With Cuban support, the MPLA held Luanda and declared independence on 11 November 1975, with   becoming the first president, though the civil war continued.  Jose Eduardo dos Santos won the   and   and became the first elected President of the country. The civil war continued with UNITA fighting against the MPLA, with both parties receiving international support. There was a ceasefire agreement during 1989, with the leader of UNITA,  , but it collapsed soon afterwards. As a part of its peace efforts, the MPLA dropped its theme of Marxism–Leninism and moved to socialism. During May 1991, Dos Sambos and Savimbi signed a multiparty democracy agreement in  . 
 Voter registration was carried out between 20 May and 31 July and the National Electoral Council enrolled a total of 4,828,468 eligible voters. Campaigning was intense from two of the major parties; UNITA campaigned against the colonial influence of Portugal and proposed a native setup. The elections were monitored by 800 representatives of the UN Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM).
 Voter turnout was around 75 per cent voter, with the UN airlifting people in remote areas to the polling stations. Early counting indicated that MPLA was leading in most constituencies; UNITA immediately rejected the result and pulled out its forces out of the combined troops of the army and started preparing for a war. The National Electoral Council delayed announcing the results beyond the eight-day limit prescribed and announced the results on 17 October 1992. 
 A total of 12 parties won seats, with the ruling MPLA winning nearly 54% of the total votes and 129 of the 220 seats, whilst UNITA won 70 seats. The first multi-party parliament session was convened on 26 October 1992 with all members of UNITA abstaining. 
 The ruling MPLA won both elections, but the eight opposition parties, in particular UNITA, rejected the results as rigged.

As a consequence, hostilities erupted in Luanda and immediately spread to other parts of the country. Several thousand to tens of thousands of UNITA members or supporters were killed nationwide by MPLA forces in a few days, in what is known as the  . War resumed immediately. 
 According to the constitution adopted in 1992, since dos Santos failed to win 50 percent of the vote, he would have faced Savimbi in a runoff election. However, Savimbi refused to take part in the runoff, saying the election had neither been free nor fair.  Due to the resumption of the Civil War, the second round never took place, and dos Santos continued as President, even without the constitutionally-necessary democratic legitimisation. Dos Santos assumed office for the third continuous term as President on 2 December 1992 and appointed   as the new Prime Minister of Angola. Most of the ministries were given to MPLA, while UNITA was offered six portfolios, which was accepted only later. There were four other portfolios allocated to other parties.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Flag_of_Angola.svg/50px-Flag_of_Angola.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Jos%C3%A9_Eduardo_dos_Santos-16062014-edit.jpg/143px-Jos%C3%A9_Eduardo_dos_Santos-16062014-edit.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Jonas_Savimbi.jpg/122px-Jonas_Savimbi.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Mapa_de_las_elecciones_presidenciales_de_Angola_de_1992.svg/250px-Mapa_de_las_elecciones_presidenciales_de_Angola_de_1992.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Mapa_de_las_elecciones_generales_de_Angola_de_1992_-_Resultados_por_distrito.svg/290px-Mapa_de_las_elecciones_generales_de_Angola_de_1992_-_Resultados_por_distrito.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Emblem_of_Angola.svg/125px-Emblem_of_Angola.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Jos%C3%A9_Eduardo_dos_Santos-16062014-edit.jpg/191px-Jos%C3%A9_Eduardo_dos_Santos-16062014-edit.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Angola_National_Assembly_1992_%28detailed%29.svg/360px-Angola_National_Assembly_1992_%28detailed%29.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Flag_of_Angola.svg/23px-Flag_of_Angola.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Angolan_general_election

en.wikipedia.org,Mailchimp - Wikipedia,"is a   and   platform.  ""Mailchimp"" is the trade name of its operator, Rocket Science Group  , an American   founded in 2001 by   and Mark Armstrong,  with   joining at a later date. 
 Mailchimp was launched in 2001.  The platform was named after one of their most popular e-greetings card characters, earning a few thousand dollars monthly.  Mailchimp began as a paid service and added a   option in 2009. Within a year, its user base had grown from 85,000 to 450,000.  By June 2014, it was sending over 10 billion emails per month on behalf of its users.  More than 600 million emails are sent through the platform every two days. 
 In 2016, Mailchimp was ranked No. 7 on the   Cloud 100 list.  In February 2017, the company was named one of  's Most Innovative Companies of 2017.  In August 2017, it was reported that Mailchimp would be opening offices in   and  . 
 In February 2019, Mailchimp acquired  , a smaller competitor.  Mailchimp later announced its plans to shift from mail distribution to offering a full marketing platform aimed at smaller organizations. This shift includes allowing customers to record and track customer leads within the platform, build landing pages and websites, and run ad retargeting advertisements on   and  .  As part of this, Mailchimp acquired the   based media and magazine company Courier Media in March 2020, with the stated goal of international growth. The magazine has a readership of 100,000 readers in more than 26 countries. 
 With founders Armstrong and Chestnut starting the company without outside funding or plans to go public, and never bringing on any outside investors thereafter, Mailchimp is considered an example of a successfully   startup. 
 After turning down repeated acquisition offers for 20 years,   reported on August 31, 2021, that Mailchimp was talking with   about being acquired.  On September 13, 2021,   confirmed it would acquire Mailchimp for approximately $12 billion in cash and stock.  On November 1, 2021,   officially completed the acquisition for $5.7bn in cash, $6.3bn in  , and 573,000   units. After the acquisition, Intuit changed the name of the platform to Intuit Mailchimp. 
 As a   advertiser, Mailchimp sponsored the launch of  , a podcast exploring a murder case over multiple episodes.  One ad became memorable for its inclusion of an unscripted mispronunciation of the company's name – ""MailKimp"" – as spoken by a 14-year-old girl from   waiting in line for an  .  The ad was parodied and ""MailKimp"" became a  .  In response, Mailchimp bought the domain name mailkimp.com and redirected traffic to mailchimp.com. 
 In 2018, Mailchimp underwent a brand redesign to help visually demonstrate an evolution from an email marketing tool to a larger marketing platform. This redesign included an updated logo, color palette, typeface, new imagery, and illustrations. It updated the Mailchimp   to ""Mailchimp"" rather than ""MailChimp"" with an uppercase letter ""C"". 
 In February 2016, Mailchimp announced it was merging Mandrill transactional email service into Mailchimp as an add-on feature and gave customers 60 days' notice to switch to the new pricing structure or find an alternative service platform.  The new pricing structure required a paid Mailchimp plan before being able to purchase Mandrill credits, resulting in customers paying for two products to access Mandrill. 
 Previously, customers were able to purchase Mandrill credits for sending emails without signing up on Mailchimp. The credits were originally priced at $9.95 for 25,000 emails but increased to $20 for the same number of emails under the new pricing scheme. In addition to needing to purchase Mandrill credits, customers now need to be on a paid Mailchimp monthly plan (the minimum monthly plan being $10 a month), even if the customer has no need for Mailchimp services and only wants access to Mandrill. Mandrill was later renamed Mailchimp Transactional. 
 In March 2022, Mailchimp suffered a data breach whereby intruders gained access to the data of 319 of their customers through  . The exposed data includes email address, IP address, and the approximate location of their mailing list recipients. 
 In January 2023, Mailchimp confirmed another breach of data for 133 accounts via social engineering.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-Ambox_important.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/72/Mailchimp_logo.svg/220px-Mailchimp_logo.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MailChi.mp

en.wikipedia.org,Collective intelligence - Wikipedia,"( ) is shared or   ( ) that   from the  , collective efforts, and competition of many individuals and appears in  . The term appears in  ,   and in context of mass   and   applications. It may involve  ,   and   such as  ,   and other means of quantifying mass activity.  Collective   is a measure of collective intelligence, although it is often used interchangeably with the term collective intelligence. Collective intelligence has also been attributed to   and animals. 
 It can be understood as an   from the   among:
 Or it can be more narrowly understood as an emergent property between people and ways of processing information.  This notion of collective intelligence is referred to as ""symbiotic intelligence"" by Norman Lee Johnson.  The concept is used in  ,  ,   and mass communications: it also appears in  .   defines collective intelligence as, ""It is a form of universally distributed intelligence, constantly enhanced, coordinated in real time, and resulting in the effective mobilization of skills. I'll add the following indispensable characteristic to this definition: The basis and goal of collective intelligence is mutual recognition and enrichment of individuals rather than the cult of fetishized or   communities.""  According to researchers Pierre Lévy and  , it refers to capacity of networked   (Information communication technologies) to enhance the collective pool of social knowledge by simultaneously expanding the extent of human interactions.   A broader definition was provided by   in a series of lectures and reports from 2006 onwards   and in the book Big Mind   which proposed a framework for analysing any thinking system, including both human and machine intelligence, in terms of functional elements (observation, prediction, creativity, judgement etc.), learning loops and forms of organisation. The aim was to provide a way to diagnose, and improve, the collective intelligence of a city, business, NGO or parliament.
 Collective intelligence strongly contributes to the shift of knowledge and power from the individual to the collective. According to   in 1998 and JC Herz in 2005,    will eventually generate superior outcomes to knowledge generated by proprietary software developed within corporations.  Media theorist   sees collective intelligence as an 'alternative source of media power', related to convergence culture. He draws attention to education and the way people are learning to participate in knowledge cultures outside formal learning settings. Henry Jenkins criticizes schools which promote 'autonomous problem solvers and self-contained learners' while remaining hostile to learning through the means of collective intelligence.  Both Pierre Lévy and Henry Jenkins support the claim that collective intelligence is important for  , as it is interlinked with knowledge-based culture and sustained by collective idea sharing, and thus contributes to a better understanding of diverse society. 
 Similar to the   for general individual intelligence, a new scientific understanding of collective intelligence aims to extract a general collective intelligence factor   for groups indicating a group's ability to perform a wide range of tasks.  Definition, operationalization and statistical methods are derived from  . Similarly as   is highly interrelated with the concept of  ,  this measurement of collective intelligence can be interpreted as intelligence quotient for groups (Group-IQ) even though the score is not a quotient per se. Causes for   and predictive validity are investigated as well.
 Writers who have influenced the idea of collective intelligence include  ,   (1979), Peter Russell (1983),   (1993),   (1994),   (1995),   (1995),  , Louis Rosenberg,  ,  ,   (2003), and  .
 The concept (although not so named) originated in 1785 with the  , whose   states that if each member of a voting group is more likely than not to make a correct decision, the probability that the highest vote of the group is the correct decision increases with the number of members of the group.  Many theorists have interpreted  's statement in the   that ""a feast to which many contribute is better than a dinner provided out of a single purse"" to mean that just as many may bring different dishes to the table, so in a deliberation many may contribute different pieces of information to generate a better decision.  Recent scholarship,  however, suggests that this was probably not what Aristotle meant but is a modern interpretation based on what we now know about team intelligence. 
 A precursor of the concept is found in entomologist  's observation in 1910 that seemingly independent individuals can cooperate so closely as to become indistinguishable from a single organism.  Wheeler saw this collaborative process at work in   that acted like the cells of a single beast he called a  .
 In 1912   identified society as the sole source of human logical thought. He argued in "" "" that society constitutes a higher intelligence because it transcends the individual over space and time.  Other antecedents are   and  's concept of "" "" and  's concept of "" "".  Peter Russell,  , and   (originator of the term ""conscious evolution"")  are inspired by the visions of a noosphere – a transcendent, rapidly evolving collective intelligence – an informational cortex of the planet. The notion has more recently been examined by the philosopher Pierre Lévy. In a 1962 research report,   linked collective intelligence to organizational effectiveness, and predicted that pro-actively 'augmenting human intellect' would yield a multiplier effect in group problem solving: ""Three people working together in this augmented mode [would] seem to be more than three times as effective in solving a complex problem as is one augmented person working alone"".  In 1994, he coined the term 'collective IQ' as a measure of collective intelligence, to focus attention on the opportunity to significantly raise collective IQ in business and society. 
 The idea of collective intelligence also forms the framework for contemporary democratic theories often referred to as  . Epistemic democratic theories refer to the capacity of the populace, either through deliberation or aggregation of knowledge, to track the truth and relies on mechanisms to synthesize and apply collective intelligence. 
 Collective intelligence was introduced into the machine learning community in the late 20th century,  and matured into a broader consideration of how to design ""collectives"" of self-interested adaptive agents to meet a system-wide goal.  This was related to single-agent work on ""reward shaping""  and has been taken forward by numerous researchers in the game theory and engineering communities. 
  has discussed mass behavior –   from the level of quarks to the level of bacterial, plant, animal, and human societies. He stresses the biological adaptations that have turned most of this earth's living beings into components of what he calls ""a learning machine"". In 1986 Bloom combined the concepts of  ,  ,  , and the superorganism to produce a theory of how collective intelligence works.  Later he showed how the collective intelligences of competing bacterial colonies and human societies can be explained in terms of computer-generated "" "" and the "" "", concepts pioneered by  . 
 Bloom traced the evolution of collective intelligence to our bacterial ancestors 1 billion years ago and demonstrated how a multi-species intelligence has worked since the beginning of life.    exhibit more intelligence, in terms of technology, than any other animal except for humans and co-operate in keeping livestock, for example   for ""milking"".  Leaf cutters care for fungi and carry leaves to feed the fungi. 
  cites the concept of a 'group mind' as being derived from Plato's concept of   (that mind or consciousness is omnipresent and exists in all matter). He develops the concept of a 'group mind' as articulated by   in ""Leviathan"" and  's arguments for a   of mankind. He cites   as the most notable advocate of a ""collective consciousness""  and   as a thinker who has developed the philosophical implications of the group mind. 
 Tom Atlee focuses primarily on humans and on work to upgrade what Howard Bloom calls ""the group IQ"". Atlee feels that collective intelligence can be encouraged ""to overcome ' ' and individual   in order to allow a collective to cooperate on one process – while achieving enhanced intellectual performance."" George Pór defined the collective intelligence phenomenon as ""the capacity of human communities to evolve towards higher order complexity and harmony, through such innovation mechanisms as differentiation and integration, competition and collaboration.""  Atlee and Pór state that ""collective intelligence also involves achieving a single focus of attention and standard of metrics which provide an appropriate threshold of action"".  Their approach is rooted in  . 
 The term group intelligence is sometimes used interchangeably with the term collective intelligence. Anita Woolley presents Collective intelligence as a measure of group intelligence and group creativity.  The idea is that a measure of collective intelligence covers a broad range of features of the group, mainly group composition and group interaction.  The features of composition that lead to increased levels of collective intelligence in groups include criteria such as higher numbers of women in the group as well as increased diversity of the group. 
 Atlee and Pór suggest that the field of collective intelligence should primarily be seen as a human enterprise in which mind-sets, a willingness to share and an openness to the value of distributed intelligence for the common good are paramount, though group theory and   have something to offer.  Individuals who respect collective intelligence are confident of their own abilities and recognize that the whole is indeed greater than the sum of any individual parts.  Maximizing collective intelligence relies on the ability of an organization to accept and develop ""The Golden Suggestion"", which is any potentially useful input from any member.    often hampers collective intelligence by limiting input to a select few individuals or filtering potential Golden Suggestions without fully developing them to implementation. 
  in   portrayed all citizens as ""intelligence minutemen,"" drawing only on legal and ethical sources of information, able to create a ""public intelligence"" that keeps public officials and corporate managers honest, turning the concept of ""national intelligence"" (previously concerned about spies and secrecy) on its head. 
 According to   and  , collective intelligence is  . In order for this concept to happen, four principles need to exist: 
 A new scientific understanding of collective intelligence defines it as a group's general ability to perform a wide range of tasks.  Definition, operationalization and statistical methods are similar to the  . Hereby, an individual's performance on a given set of cognitive tasks is used to measure general cognitive ability indicated by the general intelligence   proposed by English psychologist   and extracted via  .  In the same vein as   serves to display between-individual performance differences on cognitive tasks, collective intelligence research aims to find a parallel intelligence factor for groups   factor'  (also called 'collective intelligence factor' ( ) ) displaying between-group differences on task performance. The collective intelligence score then is used to predict how this same group will perform on any other similar task in the future. Yet tasks, hereby, refer to mental or intellectual tasks performed by small groups  even though the concept is hoped to be transferable to other performances and any groups or crowds reaching from families to companies and even whole cities.  Since individuals'   factor scores are highly correlated with full-scale   scores, which are in turn regarded as good estimates of  ,  this measurement of collective intelligence can also be seen as an intelligence indicator or quotient respectively for a group (Group-IQ) parallel to an individual's intelligence quotient (IQ) even though the score is not a quotient per se.
 Mathematically,   and   are both variables summarizing positive correlations among different tasks supposing that performance on one task is comparable with performance on other similar tasks.    thus is a source of variance among groups and can only be considered as a group's standing on the   factor compared to other groups in a given relevant population.  The concept is in contrast to competing hypotheses including other correlational structures to explain group intelligence,  such as a composition out of several equally important but independent factors as found in  . 
 Besides, this scientific idea also aims to explore the causes affecting collective intelligence, such as group size, collaboration tools or group members' interpersonal skills.  The  , for instance, announced the detection of   as one of its main goals aiming to develop a ""taxonomy of organizational building blocks, or genes, that can be combined and recombined to harness the intelligence of crowds"". 
 Individual intelligence is shown to be genetically and environmentally influenced.  Analogously, collective intelligence research aims to explore reasons why certain groups perform more intelligently than other groups given that   is just moderately correlated with the intelligence of individual group members.  According to Woolley et al.'s results, neither team cohesion nor motivation or satisfaction is correlated with  . However, they claim that three factors were found as significant correlates: the variance in the number of speaking turns, group members' average social sensitivity and the proportion of females. All three had similar predictive power for  , but only social sensitivity was statistically significant (b=0.33, P=0.05). 
 The number speaking turns indicates that ""groups where a few people dominated the conversation were less collectively intelligent than those with a more equal distribution of conversational turn-taking"".  Hence, providing multiple team members the chance to speak up made a group more intelligent. 
 Group members' social sensitivity was measured via the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test  (RME) and correlated .26 with  .  Hereby, participants are asked to detect thinking or feeling expressed in other peoples' eyes presented on pictures and assessed in a multiple choice format. The test aims to measure peoples'  , also called 'mentalizing'  or 'mind reading',  which refers to the ability to attribute mental states, such as beliefs, desires or intents, to other people and in how far people understand that others have beliefs, desires, intentions or perspectives different from their own ones.  RME is a ToM test for adults  that shows sufficient test-retest reliability  and constantly differentiates control groups from individuals with functional   or  .  It is one of the most widely accepted and well-validated tests for ToM within adults.  ToM can be regarded as an associated subset of skills and abilities within the broader concept of  . 
 The proportion of females as a predictor of   was   which is in vein with previous research showing that women score higher on social sensitivity tests.  While a  , statistically speaking, clarifies the mechanism underlying the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable,  Wolley agreed in an interview with the   that these findings are saying that groups of women are smarter than groups of men.  However, she relativizes this stating that the actual important thing is the high social sensitivity of group members. 
 It is theorized that the collective intelligence factor   is an emergent property resulting from bottom-up as well as top-down processes.  Hereby, bottom-up processes cover aggregated group-member characteristics. Top-down processes cover group structures and norms that influence a group's way of collaborating and coordinating. 
 Top-down processes cover group interaction, such as structures, processes, and norms.  An example of such top-down processes is conversational turn-taking.  Research further suggest that collectively intelligent groups communicate more in general as well as more equally; same applies for participation and is shown for face-to-face as well as online groups communicating only via writing. 
 Bottom-up processes include group composition,  namely the characteristics of group members which are aggregated to the team level.  An example of such bottom-up processes is the average social sensitivity or the average and maximum intelligence scores of group members.  Furthermore, collective intelligence was found to be related to a group's cognitive diversity  including thinking styles and perspectives.  Groups that are moderately diverse in   have higher collective intelligence than those who are very similar in cognitive style or very different. Consequently, groups where members are too similar to each other lack the variety of perspectives and skills needed to perform well. On the other hand, groups whose members are too different seem to have difficulties to communicate and coordinate effectively. 
 For most of human history, collective intelligence was confined to small tribal groups in which opinions were aggregated through real-time parallel interactions among members.  In modern times, mass communication, mass media, and networking technologies have enabled collective intelligence to span massive groups, distributed across continents and time-zones. To accommodate this shift in scale, collective intelligence in large-scale groups been dominated by serialized polling processes such as aggregating up-votes, likes, and ratings over time. While modern systems benefit from larger group size, the serialized process has been found to introduce substantial noise that distorts the collective output of the group. In one significant study of serialized collective intelligence, it was found that the first vote contributed to a serialized voting system can distort the final result by 34%. 
 To address the problems of serialized aggregation of input among large-scale groups, recent advancements collective intelligence have worked to replace serialized votes, polls, and markets, with parallel systems such as "" "" modeled after synchronous swarms in nature.  Based on natural process of  , these artificial swarms of networked humans enable participants to work together in parallel to answer questions and make predictions as an emergent collective intelligence.  In one high-profile example, a human swarm challenge by CBS Interactive to predict the Kentucky Derby. The swarm correctly predicted the first four horses, in order, defying 542–1 odds and turning a $20 bet into $10,800. 
 The value of parallel collective intelligence was demonstrated in medical applications by researchers at   and   in a set of published studies wherein groups of human doctors were connected by real-time swarming algorithms and tasked with diagnosing chest x-rays for the presence of pneumonia.  When working together as ""human swarms,"" the groups of experienced radiologists demonstrated a 33% reduction in diagnostic errors as compared to traditional methods. 
 Woolley, Chabris, Pentland, Hashmi, & Malone (2010),  the originators of this scientific understanding of collective intelligence, found a single statistical factor for collective intelligence in their research across 192 groups with people randomly recruited from the public. In Woolley et al.'s two initial studies, groups worked together on different tasks from the  ,  a well-established taxonomy of group tasks. Tasks were chosen from all four quadrants of the circumplex and included visual puzzles, brainstorming, making collective moral judgments, and negotiating over limited resources. The results in these tasks were taken to conduct a  . Both studies showed support for a general collective intelligence factor   underlying differences in group performance with an initial eigenvalue accounting for 43% (44% in study 2) of the variance, whereas the next factor accounted for only 18% (20%). That fits the range normally found in research regarding a   typically accounting for 40% to 50% percent of between-individual performance differences on cognitive tests. 
 Afterwards, a more complex task was solved by each group to determine whether   factor scores predict performance on tasks beyond the original test. Criterion tasks were playing   against a standardized computer in the first and a complex architectural design task in the second study. In a   using both individual intelligence of group members and   to predict performance on the criterion tasks,   had a significant effect, but average and maximum individual intelligence had not. While average (r=0.15, P=0.04) and maximum intelligence (r=0.19, P=0.008) of individual group members were moderately correlated with  ,   was still a much better predictor of the criterion tasks. According to Woolley et al., this supports the existence of a collective intelligence factor   because it demonstrates an effect over and beyond group members' individual intelligence and thus that   is more than just the aggregation of the individual IQs or the influence of the group member with the highest IQ. 
 Engel et al.  (2014) replicated Woolley et al.'s findings applying an accelerated battery of tasks with a first factor in the factor analysis explaining 49% of the between-group variance in performance with the following factors explaining less than half of this amount. Moreover, they found a similar result for groups working together online communicating only via text and confirmed the role of female proportion and social sensitivity in causing collective intelligence in both cases. Similarly to Wolley et al.,  they also measured social sensitivity with the RME which is actually meant to measure people's ability to detect mental states in other peoples' eyes. The online collaborating participants, however, did neither know nor see each other at all. The authors conclude that scores on the RME must be related to a broader set of abilities of social reasoning than only drawing inferences from other people's eye expressions. 
 A collective intelligence factor   in the sense of Woolley et al.  was further found in groups of MBA students working together over the course of a semester,  in online gaming groups  as well as in groups from different cultures  and groups in different contexts in terms of short-term versus long-term groups.  None of these investigations considered team members' individual intelligence scores as control variables. 
 Note as well that the field of collective intelligence research is quite young and published empirical evidence is relatively rare yet. However, various proposals and working papers are in progress or already completed but (supposedly) still in a   publication process. 
 Next to predicting a group's performance on more complex criterion tasks as shown in the original experiments,  the collective intelligence factor   was also found to predict group performance in diverse tasks in MBA classes lasting over several months.  Thereby, highly collectively intelligent groups earned significantly higher scores on their group assignments although their members did not do any better on other individually performed assignments. Moreover, highly collective intelligent teams improved performance over time suggesting that more collectively intelligent teams learn better.  This is another potential parallel to individual intelligence where more intelligent people are found to acquire new material quicker. 
 Individual intelligence can be used to predict plenty of life outcomes from school attainment  and career success  to health outcomes  and even mortality.  Whether collective intelligence is able to predict other outcomes besides group performance on mental tasks has still to be investigated.
 Gladwell  (2008) showed that the relationship between individual IQ and success works only to a certain point and that additional IQ points over an estimate of IQ 120 do not translate into real life advantages. If a similar border exists for Group-IQ or if advantages are linear and infinite, has still to be explored. Similarly, demand for further research on possible connections of individual and collective intelligence exists within plenty of other potentially transferable logics of individual intelligence, such as, for instance, the development over time  or the question of improving intelligence.  Whereas it is controversial whether human intelligence can be enhanced via training,  a group's collective intelligence potentially offers simpler opportunities for improvement by exchanging team members or implementing structures and technologies.  Moreover, social sensitivity was found to be, at least temporarily, improvable by reading   as well as watching drama movies.  In how far such training ultimately improves collective intelligence through social sensitivity remains an open question. 
 There are further more advanced concepts and factor models attempting to explain individual cognitive ability including the categorization of intelligence in   or the  .  Further supplementing explanations and conceptualizations for the factor structure of the   of collective intelligence besides a general   factor', though, are missing yet. 
 Other scholars explain team performance by aggregating team members' general intelligence to the team level  instead of building an own overall collective intelligence measure. Devine and Philips  (2001) showed in a meta-analysis that mean cognitive ability predicts team performance in laboratory settings (0.37) as well as field settings (0.14) – note that this is only a small effect. Suggesting a strong dependence on the relevant tasks, other scholars showed that tasks requiring a high degree of communication and cooperation are found to be most influenced by the team member with the lowest cognitive ability.  Tasks in which selecting the best team member is the most successful strategy, are shown to be most influenced by the member with the highest cognitive ability. 
 Since Woolley et al.'s  results do not show any influence of group satisfaction,  , or motivation, they, at least implicitly, challenge these concepts regarding the importance for group performance in general and thus contrast meta-analytically proven evidence concerning the positive effects of  ,  motivation  and satisfaction  on group performance.
 Some scholars have noted that the evidence for collective intelligence in the body of work by Wolley et al.  is weak and may contain errors or misunderstandings of the data.  For example, Woolley et al.  stated in their findings that the maximum individual score on the Wonderlic Personnel Test (WPT;  an individual intelligence test used in their research) was 39, but also that the maximum averaged team score on the same test was also a 39. This indicates that their sample seemingly had a team composed entirely of people who, individually, got exactly the same score on the WPT, and also all happened to all have achieved the highest scores on the WPT found in Woolley et al.  This was noted by scholars as particularly unlikely to occur.  Other anomalies found in the data indicate that results may be driven in part by low-effort responding.  For instance, Woolley et al.'s  data indicates that at least one team scored a 0 on a task in which they were given 10 minutes to come up with as many uses for a brick as possible. Similarly, Woolley et al.'s  data show that at least one team had an average score of 8 out of 50 on the WPT. Scholars have noted that the probability of this occurring with study participants who are putting forth effort is nearly zero.  This may explain why Woolley et al.  found that the group's individual intelligence scores were not predictive of performance. In addition, low effort on tasks in human subjects research may inflate evidence for a supposed collective intelligence factor based on similarity of performance across tasks, because a team's low effort on one research task may generalize to low effort across many tasks.  It is notable that such a phenomenon is present merely because of the low stakes setting of laboratory research for research participants and not because it reflects how teams operate in organizations. 
 Noteworthy is also that the involved researchers among the confirming findings widely overlap with each other and with the authors participating in the original first study around Anita Woolley. 
 On May 3, 2022, the authors of ""Quantifying collective intelligence in human groups"",  who include Riedl and Woolley from the original 2010 paper on Collective Intelligence,  issued a correction to the article after mathematically impossible findings reported in the article were noted publicly by researcher Marcus Credé. Among the corrections is an admission that the average variance extracted (AVE)--that is to say, the evidence for collective intelligence—was only 19.6% from their Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Notable is that an AVE of at least 50% is generally required to demonstrate evidence for convergent validity of a single factor, with greater than 70% generally indicating good evidence for the factor.  Therefore, the evidence for collective intelligence referred to as ""robust"" in Riedl et al.  is in fact quite weak or nonexistent, as their primary evidence does not meet or near even the lowest thresholds of acceptable evidence for a latent factor.  Curiously, despite this and several other factual inaccuracies found throughout the article, the paper has not been retracted, and these inaccuracies were apparently not originally detected by the author team, peer reviewers, or editors of the journal. 
 In 2001, Tadeusz (Tad) Szuba from the   in Poland proposed a formal model for the phenomenon of collective intelligence. It is assumed to be an unconscious, random, parallel, and distributed computational process, run in mathematical logic by the social structure. 
 In this model, beings and information are modeled as abstract information molecules carrying expressions of mathematical logic.  They are quasi-randomly displacing due to their interaction with their environments with their intended displacements.  Their interaction in abstract computational space creates multi-thread inference process which we perceive as collective intelligence.  Thus, a non-  model of computation is used. This theory allows simple formal definition of collective intelligence as the property of   and seems to be working well for a wide spectrum of beings, from bacterial colonies up to human social structures. Collective intelligence considered as a specific computational process is providing a straightforward explanation of several social phenomena. For this model of collective intelligence, the formal definition of IQS (IQ Social) was proposed and was defined as ""the probability function over the time and domain of N-element inferences which are reflecting inference activity of the social structure"".  While IQS seems to be computationally hard, modeling of social structure in terms of a computational process as described above gives a chance for approximation.  Prospective applications are optimization of companies through the maximization of their IQS, and the analysis of drug resistance against collective intelligence of bacterial colonies. 
 One measure sometimes applied, especially by more artificial intelligence focused theorists, is a ""collective intelligence quotient""  (or ""cooperation quotient"") – which can be normalized from the ""individual""   (IQ)  – thus making it possible to determine the marginal intelligence added by each new individual participating in the  , thus using   to avoid the hazards of   and  . 
 There have been many recent applications of collective intelligence, including in fields such as crowd-sourcing, citizen science and prediction markets. The Nesta Centre for Collective Intelligence Design   was launched in 2018 and has produced many surveys of applications as well as funding experiments. In 2020 the UNDP Accelerator Labs   began using collective intelligence methods in their work to accelerate innovation for the  .
 Here, the goal is to get an estimate (in a single value) of something. For example, estimating the weight of an object, or the release date of a product or probability of success of a project etc. as seen in prediction markets like Intrade, HSX or InklingMarkets and also in several implementations of crowdsourced estimation of a numeric outcome such as the  . Essentially, we try to get the average value of the estimates provided by the members in the crowd.
 In this situation, opinions are gathered from the crowd regarding an idea, issue or product. For example, trying to get a rating (on some scale) of a product sold online (such as Amazon's star rating system). Here, the emphasis is to collect and simply aggregate the ratings provided by customers/users.
 In these problems, someone solicits ideas for projects, designs or solutions from the crowd. For example, ideas on solving a   problem (as in  ) or getting a good design for a T-shirt (as in  ) or in getting answers to simple problems that only humans can do well (as in Amazon's Mechanical Turk). The objective is to gather the ideas and devise some selection criteria to choose the best ideas.
  divides the advantages of disorganized decision-making into three main categories, which are cognition, cooperation and coordination. 
 Because of the Internet's ability to rapidly convey large amounts of information throughout the world, the use of collective intelligence to predict stock prices and stock price direction has become increasingly viable.  Websites aggregate stock market information that is as current as possible so professional or amateur stock analysts can publish their viewpoints, enabling amateur investors to submit their financial opinions and create an aggregate opinion.  The opinion of all investor can be weighed equally so that a pivotal premise of the effective application of collective intelligence can be applied: the masses, including a broad spectrum of stock market expertise, can be utilized to more accurately predict the behavior of financial markets. 
 Collective intelligence underpins the   of   – although the term collective intelligence is not used explicitly in his paper. Fama cites research conducted by   in which 89 out of 115 selected funds underperformed relative to the index during the period from 1955 to 1964. But after removing the loading charge (up-front fee) only 72 underperformed while after removing brokerage costs only 58 underperformed. On the basis of such evidence   became popular investment vehicles using the collective intelligence of the market, rather than the judgement of professional fund managers, as an investment strategy. 
 Political parties mobilize large numbers of people to form policy, select candidates and finance and run election campaigns.  Knowledge focusing through various   methods allows perspectives to converge through the assumption that uninformed voting is to some degree random and can be filtered from the decision process leaving only a residue of informed consensus.  Critics point out that often bad ideas, misunderstandings, and misconceptions are widely held, and that structuring of the decision process must favor experts who are presumably less prone to random or misinformed voting in a given context. 
 Companies such as Affinnova (acquired by Nielsen),  ,  ,  , and   have successfully employed the concept of collective intelligence in bringing about the next generation of technological changes through their research and development (R&D), customer service, and knowledge management.  An example of such application is Google's Project Aristotle in 2012, where the effect of collective intelligence on team makeup was examined in hundreds of the company's R&D teams. 
 In 2012, the   (GFIS) was created by  ,  which epitomizes collective intelligence as the synergistic intersection among data/information/knowledge, software/hardware, and expertise/insights that has a recursive learning process for better decision-making than the individual players alone. 
  are often associated with the promotion and enhancement of collective intelligence. The ability of new media to easily store and retrieve information, predominantly through databases and the Internet, allows for it to be shared without difficulty. Thus, through interaction with new media, knowledge easily passes between sources  resulting in a form of collective intelligence. The use of interactive new media, particularly the internet, promotes online interaction and this distribution of knowledge between users.
 ,  , and Gottfried Mayer-Kress are among those who view collective intelligence through the lens of computer science and  . In their view, the Internet enables collective intelligence at the widest, planetary scale, thus facilitating the emergence of a  .
 The developer of the World Wide Web,  , aimed to promote sharing and publishing of information globally. Later his employer opened up the technology for free use. In the early '90s, the Internet's potential was still untapped, until the mid-1990s when 'critical mass', as termed by the head of the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), Dr.  , demanded more accessibility and utility.  The driving force of this Internet-based collective intelligence is the digitization of information and communication.  , a key theorist of new media and media convergence draws on the theory that collective intelligence can be attributed to media convergence and participatory culture.  He criticizes contemporary education for failing to incorporate online trends of collective problem solving into the classroom, stating ""whereas a collective intelligence community encourages ownership of work as a group, schools grade individuals"". Jenkins argues that interaction within a knowledge community builds vital skills for young people, and teamwork through collective intelligence communities contribute to the development of such skills.  Collective intelligence is not merely a quantitative contribution of information from all cultures, it is also qualitative. 
  and   consider CI from a mass communications perspective, focusing on the ability of networked information and communication technologies to enhance the community knowledge pool. They suggest that these communications tools enable humans to interact and to share and collaborate with both ease and speed.  With the development of the   and its widespread use, the opportunity to contribute to knowledge-building communities, such as  , is greater than ever before. These computer networks give participating users the opportunity to store and to retrieve knowledge through the collective access to these databases and allow them to ""harness the hive""  Researchers at the   research and explore collective intelligence of groups of people and computers. 
 In this context collective intelligence is often confused with  . The former is the sum total of information held individually by members of a community while the latter is information that is believed to be true and known by all members of the community.  Collective intelligence as represented by   has less user engagement than  . An art project using Web 2.0 platforms is ""Shared Galaxy"", an experiment developed by an anonymous artist to create a collective identity that shows up as one person on several platforms like MySpace, Facebook, YouTube and Second Life. The password is written in the profiles and the accounts named ""Shared Galaxy"" are open to be used by anyone. In this way many take part in being one.  Another art project using collective intelligence to produce artistic work is Curatron, where a large group of artists together decides on a smaller group that they think would make a good collaborative group. The process is used based on an algorithm computing the collective preferences  In creating what he calls 'CI-Art', Nova Scotia based artist Mathew Aldred follows Pierry Lévy's definition of collective intelligence.  Aldred's CI-Art event in March 2016 involved over four hundred people from the community of Oxford, Nova Scotia, and internationally.  Later work developed by Aldred used the UNU   system to create digital drawings and paintings.  The Oxford Riverside Gallery (Nova Scotia) held a public CI-Art event in May 2016, which connected with online participants internationally. 
 In   (also called collaborative tagging),  users assign tags to resources shared with other users, which gives rise to a type of information organisation that emerges from this   process. The resulting information structure can be seen as reflecting the collective knowledge (or collective intelligence) of a community of users and is commonly called a "" "", and the process can be captured by  . 
 Recent research using data from the social bookmarking website  , has shown that collaborative tagging systems exhibit a form of   (or  ) dynamics.  Although there is no central controlled vocabulary to constrain the actions of individual users, the distributions of tags that describe different resources has been shown to converge over time to a stable   distributions.  Once such stable distributions form, examining the   between different tags can be used to construct simple folksonomy graphs, which can be efficiently partitioned to obtained a form of community or shared vocabularies.  Such vocabularies can be seen as a form of collective intelligence, emerging from the decentralised actions of a community of users. The Wall-it Project is also an example of social bookmarking. 
 Research performed by Tapscott and Williams has provided a few examples of the benefits of collective intelligence to business: 
 Cultural theorist and online community developer, John Banks considered the contribution of online fan communities in the creation of the   product. He argued that its commercial success was fundamentally dependent upon ""the formation and growth of an active and vibrant online fan community that would both actively promote the product and create content- extensions and additions to the game software"". 
 The increase in user created content and interactivity gives rise to issues of control over the game itself and ownership of the player-created content. This gives rise to fundamental legal issues, highlighted by Lessig  and Bray and Konsynski,  such as   and property ownership rights.
 Gosney extends this issue of Collective Intelligence in videogames one step further in his discussion of  . This genre, he describes as an ""across-media game that deliberately blurs the line between the in-game and out-of-game experiences""  as events that happen outside the game reality ""reach out"" into the player's lives in order to bring them together. Solving the game requires ""the collective and collaborative efforts of multiple players""; thus the issue of collective and collaborative team play is essential to ARG. Gosney argues that the Alternate Reality genre of gaming dictates an unprecedented level of collaboration and ""collective intelligence"" in order to solve the mystery of the game. 
 Co-operation helps to solve most important and most interesting multi-science problems. In his book, James Surowiecki mentioned that most scientists think that benefits of co-operation have much more value when compared to potential costs. Co-operation works also because at best it guarantees number of different viewpoints. Because of the possibilities of technology global co-operation is nowadays much easier and productive than before. It is clear that, when co-operation goes from university level to global it has significant benefits.
 For example, why do scientists co-operate? Science has become more and more isolated and each science field has spread even more and it is impossible for one person to be aware of all developments. This is true especially in experimental research where highly advanced equipment requires special skills. With co-operation scientists can use information from different fields and use it effectively instead of gathering all the information just by reading by themselves."" 
 Military, trade unions, and corporations satisfy some definitions of CI – the most rigorous definition would require a capacity to respond to very arbitrary conditions without orders or guidance from ""law"" or ""customers"" to constrain actions. Online advertising companies are using collective intelligence to bypass traditional marketing and creative agencies. 
 The   open platform for ""human swarming"" (or ""social swarming"") establishes real-time closed-loop systems around groups of networked users molded after biological swarms, enabling human participants to behave as a unified collective intelligence.  When connected to UNU, groups of distributed users collectively answer questions and make predictions in real-time.  Early testing shows that human swarms can out-predict individuals.  In 2016, an UNU swarm was challenged by a reporter to predict the winners of the Kentucky Derby, and successfully picked the first four horses, in order, beating 540 to 1 odds. 
 Specialized information sites such as Digital Photography Review  or Camera Labs  is an example of collective intelligence. Anyone who has an access to the internet can contribute to distributing their knowledge over the world through the specialized information sites.
 In   a group of users marshal resources to create an ecology that meets their needs often (but not only) in relation to the co-configuration, co-creation and co-design of a particular learning space that allows learners to create their own context.  Learner-generated contexts represent an   community that facilitates coordination of collective action in a network of trust. An example of learner-generated context is found on the Internet when collaborative users pool knowledge in a ""shared intelligence space"". As the Internet has developed so has the concept of CI as a shared public forum. The global accessibility and availability of the Internet has allowed more people than ever to contribute and access ideas. 
 Games such as   Series, and   are designed to be non-linear and to depend on collective intelligence for expansion. This way of sharing is gradually evolving and influencing the mindset of the current and future generations.  For them, collective intelligence has become a norm. In Terry Flew's discussion of ' ' in the online games environment, the ongoing interactive dialogue between users and game developers,  he refers to Pierre Lévy's concept of Collective Intelligence  and argues this is active in videogames as clans or guilds in   constantly work to achieve goals.   proposes that the participatory cultures emerging between games producers, media companies, and the end-users mark a fundamental shift in the nature of media production and consumption. Jenkins argues that this new participatory culture arises at the intersection of three broad new media trends.  Firstly, the development of new media tools/technologies enabling the creation of content. Secondly, the rise of subcultures promoting such creations, and lastly, the growth of value adding media conglomerates, which foster image, idea and narrative flow.
 Improvisational actors also experience a type of collective intelligence which they term ""group mind"", as theatrical improvisation relies on mutual cooperation and agreement,  leading to the unity of ""group mind"". 
 Growth of the Internet and mobile telecom has also produced ""swarming"" or ""rendezvous"" events that enable meetings or even dates on demand.  The full impact has yet to be felt but the  , for example, relies heavily on e-mail, cell phones, pagers, SMS and other means of organizing.  The   organization does this in a more journalistic way.  Such resources could combine into a form of collective intelligence accountable only to the current participants yet with some strong moral or linguistic guidance from generations of contributors – or even take on a more obviously democratic form to advance shared goal. 
 A further application of collective intelligence is found in the ""Community Engineering for Innovations"".  In such an integrated framework proposed by Ebner et al., idea competitions and virtual communities are combined to better realize the potential of the collective intelligence of the participants, particularly in open-source R&D.  In management theory the use of collective intelligence and crowd sourcing leads to innovations and very robust answers to quantitative issues.  Therefore, collective intelligence and crowd sourcing is not necessarily leading to the best solution to economic problems, but to a stable, good solution.
 Collective actions or tasks require different amounts of coordination depending on the complexity of the task. Tasks vary from being highly independent simple tasks that require very little coordination to complex interdependent tasks that are built by many individuals and require a lot of coordination. In the article written by Kittur, Lee and Kraut the writers introduce a problem in cooperation: ""When tasks require high coordination because the work is highly interdependent, having more contributors can increase process losses, reducing the effectiveness of the group below what individual members could optimally accomplish"". Having a team too large the overall effectiveness may suffer even when the extra contributors increase the resources. In the end the overall costs from coordination might overwhelm other costs. 
 Group collective intelligence is a property that emerges through coordination from both bottom-up and top-down processes. In a bottom-up process the different characteristics of each member are involved in contributing and enhancing coordination. Top-down processes are more strict and fixed with norms, group structures and routines that in their own way enhance the group's collective work. 
 Tom Atlee reflects that, although humans have an innate ability to gather and analyze data, they are affected by culture, education and social institutions.  A single person tends to make decisions motivated by self-preservation. Therefore, without collective intelligence, humans may drive themselves into extinction based on their selfish needs. 
 Phillip Brown and Hugh Lauder quotes Bowles and   (1976) that in order to truly define collective intelligence, it is crucial to separate 'intelligence' from IQism.  They go on to argue that intelligence is an achievement and can only be developed if allowed to.  For example, earlier on, groups from the lower levels of society are severely restricted from aggregating and pooling their intelligence. This is because the elites fear that the collective intelligence would convince the people to rebel. If there is no such capacity and relations, there would be no infrastructure on which collective intelligence is built.  This reflects how powerful collective intelligence can be if left to develop. 
 Skeptics, especially those critical of artificial intelligence and more inclined to believe that risk of   and bodily action are the basis of all unity between people, are more likely to emphasize the capacity of a group to take action and withstand harm as one fluid  , shrugging off harms the way a body shrugs off the loss of a few cells.  This train of thought is most obvious in the   and characterized by the works of  ,  , and  , who typically shun academics.  These theorists are more likely to refer to ecological and   and to the role of   in making ontological distinctions than to any form of ""intelligence"" as such, which they often argue does not exist, or is mere ""cleverness"". 
 Harsh critics of artificial intelligence on ethical grounds are likely to promote collective wisdom-building methods, such as the   and the  .  Whether these can be said to be collective intelligence systems is an open question. Some, e.g.  , simply wish to avoid any form of autonomous artificial intelligence and seem willing to work on rigorous collective intelligence in order to remove any possible niche for AI. 
 In contrast to these views, companies such as   and   are using collective intelligence and   or   to collect the enormous amounts of data for   algorithms.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/CI_types1s_2.jpg/300px-CI_types1s_2.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/World_Brain_HG_Wells_1938.jpg/220px-World_Brain_HG_Wells_1938.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Complex_adaptive_system.gif/220px-Complex_adaptive_system.gif|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Mass_collaboration.jpg/220px-Mass_collaboration.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Scree_plot_showing_percent_of_explained_variance_for_the_first_five_factors_in_Woolley_et_al.%27s_%282010%29_two_original_studies_as_well_as_the_individual_intelligence_test_for_all_participants_%28assessed_with_Wonderlic_Personnel_Test%29.png/220px-thumbnail.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Causes_for_c.png/220px-Causes_for_c.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Standardized_Regression_Coefficients.png/220px-Standardized_Regression_Coefficients.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Computational_collective_intelligence.jpg/220px-Computational_collective_intelligence.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/U.S._states_%28and_territories%29_by_election_methods%2C_2016.svg/220px-U.S._states_%28and_territories%29_by_election_methods%2C_2016.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Application_of_collective_intelligence_in_Millennium_Project.png/220px-Application_of_collective_intelligence_in_Millennium_Project.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Collaborative_tagging.png/220px-Collaborative_tagging.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Improvisational_actors.jpg/220px-Improvisational_actors.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Open_Access_logo_PLoS_transparent.svg/9px-Open_Access_logo_PLoS_transparent.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Auklet_flock_Shumagins_1986.jpg/140px-Auklet_flock_Shumagins_1986.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Global_thinking.svg/10px-Global_thinking.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence

en.wikipedia.org,Wikipedia:WikiProject Sweep - Wikipedia,"Welcome to  ! This collaboration aims to comprehensively review every article created in Wikipedia's early days to ensure basic conformity to modern standards. This page and its subpages aim to facilitate collaboration around this goal. If you'd like to help us, please   to the project, inquire on the  , and see the   for things to do. Thanks for helping us clean up old articles! 
 In Wikipedia's early days (very roughly prior to 2010), there were few and ill-defined notability and sourcing standards, leading to the creation of many pages that, by today's standards, should not exist or need extensive cleanup. However, because many of them are on very obscure subjects with few pageviews, they have avoided deletion or tagging with maintenance templates to alert readers about their issues. Under our prior ad hoc approach, we were unable to know how many undiscovered non-notable or otherwise deficient pages remained.
 In response to this problem,   was made in November 2020, and this project was launched in March 2021.

en.wikipedia.org,KHBS - Wikipedia,"(channel 40) is a   in  , United States, affiliated with   and  . It is simulcast full-time over     (channel 29) in  . Owned by   and jointly branded as  , the two stations maintain studios on Ajax Avenue in  , with a secondary studio and   on North Albert Pike Avenue/North 42nd Street (south of Kelley Highway) in Fort Smith. KHBS' transmitter is located on   in northwestern   (northwest of  ), while KHOG-TV's transmitter is based near Ed Edwards Road in rural northeastern  , just southeast of the Fayetteville city limits.
 KHOG-TV relays KHBS' programming to areas of   and southwestern   that are not covered by the primary station's signal. During the analog era, the Fort Smith–Fayetteville  's size and terrain precluded stations with transmitters closer to Fort Smith from reaching northern portions of the market.
 Channel 40 began as KFPW-TV on July 28, 1971. It was owned by local businessman Bob Hernreich along with   (1230 AM). The station was a primary   affiliate with a secondary ABC affiliation. Before channel 40's arrival, all three networks had been shoehorned on primary   affiliate KFSA-TV (channel 5, now CBS affiliate  ).
 KFPW-TV found the going difficult against channel 5 largely because of the difficulties experienced by UHF stations operating in rugged terrain. Most seriously, it was all but unviewable in Fayetteville and the surrounding area—a problem exacerbated by its transmitter being located in Oklahoma. Many viewers in the northern part of the market watched CBS on KTVJ in   (now NBC affiliate  ).
 A solution came in the form of the license for  , which had served Fayetteville as a primary NBC and secondary CBS affiliate on channel 36 from February 8, 1969, to December 23, 1973.  Hernreich's father, George, had actually bought KGTO in 1973 with the intent of turning it into a satellite of KFPW-TV, but concerns by the   (FCC) about Heinreich's operation of   in   delayed final FCC approval for the purchase until 1976.  Further delays came when severe damage to KGTO's transmitter, as well as a series of thefts, required building a completely new transmitter. In order to save money and return the station to the air, Hernreich moved the station's license to channel 29.  The station finally went on the air on December 8, 1977, as KTVP, a full-time satellite of KFPW-TV.
 In 1983, the Hernreich family sold off its radio stations, KFPW and KXXI-FM. The Hernreichs changed channel 40's call letters to KHBS (for Hernreich Broadcasting System) on March 21. Two years later, in 1985, Bob Hernreich bought a stake in Sigma Broadcasting (becoming its chairman and CEO in 1989), merging KHBS and KTVP into Sigma. On September 1, 1987, KTVP became KHOG-TV—a nod to the  , who are often called ""the Hogs"". Argyle Television bought the stations in 1996. A year later, Argyle merged with Hearst. In October 2007, KHBS and KHOG-TV moved their operations to new, state of the art studios in Rogers.
  (branded as  ) is the  -affiliated second   of KHBS and KHOG, broadcasting in   on channel 40.2 in Fort Smith and channel 29.2 in Fayetteville. All programming on KHBS-DT2/KHOG-DT2 is received through The CW's programming feed for smaller media markets,  , which provides a set schedule of syndicated programming acquired by The CW during time periods without network programs; however, Hearst Television handles local advertising and promotional services for the subchannel.
 KHBS-DT2's history traces back to the September 18, 2006, launch of a cable-only affiliate of The CW—a network created as a joint venture between   and the   division of  , as a   consolidation of   and   that initially featured programs from its two predecessor networks as well as new series specifically produced for The CW. —that was managed, promoted and had its advertising sales handled by local cable provider  , alongside the launch of The CW Plus, a national service that was created to provide broad coverage of The CW to smaller areas with a   market ranking above #100 and was affiliated via local origination channels managed by cable providers or local television stations and primary or subchannel-only affiliations with broadcast stations. The channel—which was branded on-air as ""KCWA"" (for ""The CW Arkansas""), an unofficial   assigned by Cox as it was a cable-exclusive outlet not licensed by the FCC—was one of the few cable-only CW Plus affiliates to have signed on at the network's launch. (The predecessor service operated by The WB,  , was affiliated with  -licensed   [channel 31, now a   owned-and-operated station], since 2001; in most markets where The CW Plus was initially available via cable, the successor cable-only CW Plus outlet usually was a former affiliate of The WB 100+.)
 On April 9, 2008, in a joint announcement by the network and KHBS/KHOG's parent company, Hearst-Argyle Television announced that it would launch a CW-affiliated digital subchannel on the DT2 feeds of KHBS and KHOG to relay the network's programming throughout the Fort Smith–Fayetteville market. Hearst-Argyle assumed promotional and advertising control of ""KCWA""—which had its former ""CW Arkansas"" branding retained in the over-the-air transition—from Cox Communications with the subsequent sign-on of KHBS/KHOG's CW subchannels, and converted the cable-only affiliate into an over-the-air digital feed on KHBS-DT 40.2 and KHOG-DT 29.2 to provide The CW's programming to viewers throughout Northwest Arkansas who do not subscribe to cable television. KHBS-DT2/KHOG-DT2 signed on as an affiliate of The CW (via The CW Plus) on April 28, 2008, assuming ""KCWA"" s former channel slot on Cox basic cable channel 4 (a high definition feed of the channel was also provided to Cox subscribers on   channel 2004).  On June 15, 2012, KHBS/KHOG upgraded ""The Arkansas CW"" subchannel to   high definition, providing over-the-air access to HD content from The CW in the Fort Smith–Fayetteville market for the first time. 
  (branded as  ) is the  -affiliated third digital subchannel of KHBS and KHOG, broadcasting in   standard definition on channel 40.3 in Fort Smith and channel 29.3 in Fayetteville. In addition to carrying MeTV programming, KHBS-DT3/KHOG-DT3 is also designated as an alternate ABC affiliate, and carries network (and occasionally, syndicated) programs that KHBS/KHOG must preempt to carry extended breaking news or severe weather coverage or special event programming on its main channel.
 KHBS/KHOG launched a digital subchannel on virtual channels 40.3 and 29.3 on January 2, 2017, to serve as an affiliate of the classic television network MeTV, under an extension of an affiliation agreement between Hearst and MeTV parent  . On August 28, 2017, KHBS-DT3/KHOG-DT3 switched to a 16:9 widescreen standard definition format; prior to the upgrade, ABC and syndicated programs presented in widescreen were transmitted on the subchannel in a horizontally compressed format to fit the subchannel's 4:3 aspect frame.
 KHBS/KHOG currently broadcasts the complete ABC network schedule, although it does not clear the   that airs during   programming in order to run additional local advertising. The station airs the   block on a one-hour delay from its ""live feed"" due to the third hour of its Saturday morning newscast, although midday   games carried by ABC during the fall may subject   programs normally aired on Saturdays in the 11 a.m. hour to be deferred to Sunday mornings to fulfill educational programming obligations. 
 The station may preempt some ABC programs in order to air long-form   or   coverage, or occasional specials produced by KHBS/KHOG's news department. However,  , which was part of the now-defunct   block until August 28, 2010, was preempted by the station, and most of the other Hearst-owned ABC affiliates of the time, for lacking   content. As well, in 2004, KHBS and the other Hearst-owned ABC affiliates ran   instead of an unedited broadcast of  . 
 ABC shows preempted or otherwise interrupted by such content may either be rebroadcast on   over KHBS/KHOG's main channel in place of regular overnight programs or diverted to its DT3 subchannel in place of MeTV programming. Station personnel also gives viewers who subscribe to  ,  ,   and other pay television providers within the KHBS/KHOG viewing area that do not carry its DT3 feed the option of watching the affected shows on ABC's desktop and mobile streaming platforms or its cable/satellite   service the day after their initial airing.
 As of September 2017 , KHBS/KHOG presently broadcasts   hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with five hours each weekday, three hours on Saturdays, and   hours on Sundays). In addition, the station produces   hours of locally produced newscasts each week for its CW-affiliated DT2 subchannel (with 1½ hours on weekdays, and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays). The station may also simulcast long-form severe weather coverage on KHBS-DT2/KHOG-DT2 in the event that a   is issued for any county in its viewing area within northwest Arkansas and  .
 On April 18, 2011, KHBS/KHOG expanded its weekday morning newscast  , to   hours from 4:30 to 7 a.m., becoming one of the smallest stations in terms of market size to extend its morning newscast to a 4:30 a.m. start time.  On September 13, 2011, the stations became the first in the Fort Smith–Fayetteville television market to begin broadcasting its newscasts in 16:9 widescreen  . The station is currently broadcast in full   high definition.
 On August 20, 2012, KHBS/KHOG debuted a half-hour prime time newscast at 9 p.m. for its DT2 subchannel, titled  . The nightly program – which airs in place of syndicated programs shown on The CW Plus's national feed during that slot.   
 An additional news expansion on ""The Arkansas CW"" took place on September 6, 2016, when KHBS/KHOG began producing a half-hour 7 a.m. extension of its weekday morning show for the subchannel, under the title  . The program features the same team that anchors  . The newscast expanded to a full hour on September 11, 2017.  The following year, on September 23, 2017, the station began producing a half-hour Saturday and Sunday edition of its 5 p.m. newscast for KHBS-DT2/KHOG-DT2.

en.wikipedia.org,WWJE-DT - Wikipedia,"(channel 50) is a   licensed to  , United States, serving the   area as an affiliate of  . It is owned by   alongside  –licensed  -    (channel 66). The two stations share main studios and transmitter facilities on Parmenter Road in  . WWJE is operated separately from WUNI's   (JSA) with  –owned   affiliate   (channel 27) in  .
 WWJE formerly broadcast local newscasts from a studio located in  , branded as the NH1 News Network or  . Besides WBIN, sister radio station   also used the   branding from August 2015 to August 2017. WBIN-TV was one of only two television stations based in the state of New Hampshire to broadcast local newscasts (alongside  ), as much of the state is part of the Boston media market. On February 17, 2017, WBIN canceled its newscasts as part of a wind-down of the station's operations following the sale of its   in the   (FCC)'s  .
 The station shut down its channel 35 transmitter on Merrill Hill in  , on September 15, 2017, and began operating on channel 27 through a channel sharing agreement with channel 66 (then WUTF-DT); the WBIN-TV license was subsequently sold by Carlisle One Media, a company controlled by  , to WUNI's owner, Univision Communications.
 The channel 50 allocation in the Boston market originally belonged to  , which launched in October 1969. It operated from two studios: its offices and master production facilities were located on Dutton Street in downtown  ; however, its transmitter and ""main"" studio was on Governor Dinsmore Road in  , to comply with FCC regulations requiring that a station's transmitter be located within 15 miles (24 km) of its  . 
 However, the station's coverage in many parts of   was spotty at best. The station's Lowell studios were located less than 1,000 feet (305 m) from the transmitter of  , making high-quality production impossible during the day due to   with the cameras. Advertisers were scared off when the   blacklisted anyone who bought commercials on the station. Bills went unpaid for several months. By early 1970, 90% of the station's staff was removed from the payroll, although many continued with the station, believing it could pull through. The Lowell studio was closed down that spring; finally, in June the power company pulled the plug at the Windham studios during a   rerun, taking WXPO off the air. 
 On July 17, 1973, channel 50 returned to the air with a test transmission, with plans to return the station to the air later that year, possibly as New Hampshire's   affiliate. Those plans never materialized, and the WXPO-TV license was deleted in 1975. 
 The current iteration of channel 50 signed on the air on September 5, 1983,  as WNDS, an   known on-air as ""The Winds of New England."" It was owned by CTV of Derry, a company not related to the   in Canada. The program included some   like   and   in the morning hours,   like   late in the morning,   on midday afternoons, cartoons for an hour or so after 3 p.m., more sitcoms in the evenings and late nights, and a   in prime time. Sitcoms came from the   and   libraries, including such well-known series as  ,  ,  ,   and  , among others.
 The station acquired some of the programming assets of   (channel 21, frequency now occupied by  ) in 1989 after that station shut down on March 31; the deal did not include the channel 21 license or WNHT's CBS affiliation.  In the 1990s, the station increased cartoons a bit and began running more recent sitcoms and  .
 In 1996, WNDS added programming from the Global Shopping Network (GSN) overnights. In January 1997, the station began running Global Shopping Network programming 15 hours a day, with entertainment programming continuing from 3 to 11 p.m. On April 5, 1997, GSN began programming the station full-time with a 24-hour   format as part of a planned purchase of the station.  However, GSN soon ran into financial problems;  after it missed a payment for the station, CTV of Derry canceled the sale and reverted WNDS to its previous general entertainment format that June.  CTV held onto channel 50 until 2004, when it sold the station to Shooting Star Broadcasting. 
 Soon after assuming control, in August 2005, Shooting Star Broadcasting announced that WNDS would change its   to WZMY-TV and its branding to  .  At that time, the station overhauled its schedule, based on viewer responses on the old WNDS website. The changes were implemented on-air on September 26, 2005. 
 On February 22, 2006,   announced the launch of a new network called  , which created in response to another upstart network that was also set to launch that September,   (an amalgamated network that originally consisted primarily of   and  's higher-rated programs). 
 Since WZMY had already filed a trademark in mid-2005 for use of the ""MyTV"" name, it was speculated that WZMY would take legal action against News Corporation over its similar name.  Ultimately on July 21, 2006, WZMY's   newsletter announced that the station would become the region's MyNetworkTV affiliate – giving channel 50 the first network affiliation in its history – this was later revealed on July 24 to the media and visitors to WZMY's website, and to the general public on July 26. Until the announcements were made, Boston and Southern New Hampshire had been the largest market where MyNetworkTV had not yet signed a full-time affiliate. With WZMY affiliating with MyNetworkTV upon the network's launch on September 5, 2006, the station continued to use its ""My TV"" branding, though the logo was changed to reflect MyNetworkTV's logo scheme (a different logo had been in use in the year following the 2005 relaunch).
 In December 2009, the station laid off seven employees as part of strategy change to streamline operations and change some of the programming options to be more hyperlocal. Operation of WZMY was taken over by New Age Media,  , making it a sister station to   and   in  .  The station added a   affiliated with   in June 2010. 
 On March 3, 2011,  -based Carlisle One Media, Inc., a company controlled by  , announced that it had reached an agreement to purchase WZMY-TV.  The sale was completed on May 17;  ten days later, the call letters were changed to WBIN-TV.  It also dropped the ""My TV New England"" branding (becoming one of a number of MyNetworkTV affiliates to not feature the programming service's branding), choosing to refer to itself using its call letters.
 Binnie originally indicated that WBIN-TV would retain its affiliations with MyNetworkTV and Universal Sports;  however, the station announced on June 15 that it would leave MyNetworkTV and become an independent again as part of an increased local emphasis, with the service's programming moving to   (channel 38) on September 19,  while Universal Sports restructured itself into a cable- and satellite-only channel in January 2012, then shut down in October 2015.  Nonetheless, the station added an additional subchannel, carrying  , in October 2011;  additionally, it replaced Universal Sports with   on January 1, 2012.  In July 2012, WBIN-TV terminated its affiliation with TheCoolTV; it was replaced with   on January 14, 2013.  The station also made moves to strengthen its programming, including the addition of   and   on September 10, 2012 (  had previously aired in New Hampshire on  ; both programs also remained on WSBK-TV).  In December 2014,   replaced WeatherNation TV on their DT3 sub-channel.  In January 2015, Live Well Network was replaced with ""WBIN Classics"" on the DT2 sub-channel, featuring original programming as well as programming from the   network. 
 WBIN was the   of Binnie Media, a group that also included WYCN-LP (channel 13) in   and 16 northern New England radio stations formerly owned by  . 
 On February 17, 2017, Binnie Media announced that WBIN-TV had sold its spectrum in the FCC's   for $68.2 million; concurrently, the station's ""remaining television license rights"" would be acquired by an undisclosed ""major television group"" for an estimated $10–30 million in what it described as a ""channel-sharing sale"". In a statement, Bill Binnie said that the sale ""makes WBIN-TV one of the most valuable media properties in the history of New Hampshire media."" Binnie Media also announced that WBIN-TV would ""cease broadcasting in the coming months"", with proceeds from the sale going toward the acquisition of additional digital, outdoor, and radio assets. 
 On May 4, 2017, WBIN-TV filed to channel-share with   (channel 66, now  ).  In the channel sharing agreement, reached on January 11, 2016, the stations agreed to grant put and call rights that could result in WUTF's owner, Univision Local Media, acquiring the WBIN license; under the terms of the agreement, Univision would be required to change WBIN-TV's call letters as a condition of the sale.  Univision exercised its option to buy the WBIN-TV license for $16,764,133.70 on May 8, 2017.  WBIN-TV ceased broadcasting on channel 35 on September 15, 2017, and began to share channel 27 with WUTF-DT;  as of September 2017 , only WBIN's main channel is broadcast using virtual channel 50.  WBIN-TV began phasing out its   following the announcement of the spectrum sale; by December 2017, the station's schedule consisted primarily of Antenna TV programming, with the talk show   (which also aired on NBC Boston) serving as its last syndicated program. Univision's purchase of the station was completed on December 21, 2017;  the station then became a Justice Network affiliate. The call letters were changed to WWJE-DT on January 12, 2018. 
 Antenna TV was absent from the Boston TV market until it was picked up by WCRN-LD on May 5, 2020.  Grit is now carried on the primary channel of  . 
 During its first year on the air, WNDS ran a number of locally produced programs, including a   ( ), a   ( ) and a weekly prime-time   ( ). All of these shows were canceled by the end of 1985. The station also covered live local sports, including  ,   and  . WNDS also ran a   show each weekend at noon called  , which aired from 1984  until August 2005. 
 Prior to affiliating with the Global Shopping Network in April 1997, WNDS also ran three additional shows:   (which provided high school sports news in the New Hampshire and Massachusetts region),   (a   show discussing Boston sports), and   (a local  ). When regular programming was restored in June, these three shows were not resurrected. In addition, during the early 2000s, channel 50 ran a   program titled   hosted by  .  , a 30-minute weekly show from independent   promotion  , aired on WNDS from 2001 to 2002. The station also aired a locally produced talk show hosted by singer-comedian Bucky Lewis.
 After the station's relaunch as WZMY-TV, much of its local programming consisted of visits to businesses around the region, in a format known as ""My Shows"". The original show under this format was  ,  but variants focusing on specific topics were subsequently added, such as   and   and  . Additionally, several local businesses (particularly car dealerships, but sometimes other businesses such as Dollar Bill's Discount World) produced programs that appeared on weekend mornings; those programs had also appeared on WNDS. At the time of the relaunch, two other local programs also existed: a talk show entitled   (which originally aired from 9 to 10 p.m.  and later from 8 to 9:30 p.m.), and   (a review of   around the region, which was produced by Dan Egan). However, the station subsequently discontinued these shows from its lineup (although   was still produced for other outlets).
 In its later years as ""My TV"", the station adopted a ""Branded Entertainment"" model, focusing on local product placement. Most of the station's local programming during this time, in addition to the remaining ""My Shows""-formatted programs, included 30-minute wrestling show from the Massachusetts-based ""Big Time Wrestling"" promotion (which aired on the station from May 1, 2009, until moving to   in December 2010),   (a talk show hosted by   personality Scorch),   (which showcases New Hampshire's top chefs creating their signature dishes),   (also aired on sister station WPME in Portland),  ,   (a reality comedy series based in  ),   (a spotlight on the  ),  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  , a reality competition show featuring brides-to-be.  Many of these programs were produced in collaboration with independent production companies through what the station referred to as ""MyTV New England Studios"". Some of these programs were retained following the relaunch as WBIN-TV, though   was dropped following the sale to Carlisle One due to concerns over the program's content,  and   and the local history show   subsequently moved to WMFP.
 Following Carlisle One Media's acquisition of the station, WBIN-TV announced that it would offer increased coverage of high school, college, and professional sports;  this includes telecasts of   hockey and basketball (produced by the   in association with Pack Network)   ,  and the  . 
 , a locally produced business newsmagazine, began airing on WBIN-TV on June 5, 2016.
 Soon after signing-on in the fall of 1983, WNDS began airing nightly newscasts at 6 and 10 p.m. The news staff included news anchor Larry Sparano, sportscaster  , and meteorologist  . The weekend newscasts were dropped in 1985, followed by the weeknight editions by 1986.
 On September 28, 1998, WNDS debuted  , consisting of newscasts at 7 and 10 p.m. weeknights,  as well as weekend afternoons (the latter of which were dropped by early 2002). By 2003, the 11:57 a.m. weekday news update was expanded into a half-hour newscast at noon. Shortly after Shooting Star bought the station, the noon broadcast was discontinued, and the 10 p.m. edition was cut down to 10 minutes.  In addition to the full newscasts, some news/weather updates as well as standalone weather updates from chief meteorologist Al Kaprielian were provided throughout the day.
 When the station was relaunched as WZMY-TV, the 10 p.m. newscast was dropped entirely; the early evening newscast was renamed   and aired weeknights from 7:30 to 8 p.m. An additional 60-minute news and commentary program,  , aired from 9 to 10 p.m.  On March 10, 2006, however, the two programs were consolidated into a new, 90-minute version of   that aired from 8 to 9:30 p.m. News was no longer provided outside of that program. By July 2006, channel 50 had discontinued   in favor of sitcom  . Weather updates from Al Kaprielian were still provided each hour from noon to midnight; for a time, these were accompanied by news updates that used the   title.
 WZMY dissolved its news department completely (with the exception of weather) in November 2007, after Nicole Papageorge and Mike DeBlasi (the longest-tenured on-air employee after Kaprielian) departed the station. As a result, WZMY eliminated all daily news cut-ins, political commentary, and locally produced public affairs programming.
 Channel 50 was well known in New England for meteorologist Al Kaprielian. His quirky, offbeat style made him a minor celebrity in Southern New Hampshire. As a result of his popularity, he appeared as a ""Guest Meteorologist"" on  's   on November 10, 2006. He had worked for WNDS/WZMY for his whole career. However, as a result of the station's December 2009 cutbacks, Kaprielian was laid off from the station, with his final day on-air occurring on  ; as a result, the station discontinued its weather updates.  Kaprielian returned to WBIN-TV on August 20, 2012, providing hourly forecasts from 2 to 9 p.m.;  he also provided forecasts for Binnie Media's radio stations.  Kaprielian left the station in 2015.
 Soon after the sale to Carlisle One, the station announced plans to re-establish a local news department, including a bureau at Carlisle One's headquarters in Portsmouth;  rival   affiliate WMUR-TV (channel 9) already operated a Portsmouth bureau. On September 29, 2011, WBIN debuted a new half-hour weeknight newscast.  Known as  , the show was produced in partnership with the  -based   (INN). The news anchor and   were provided by the centralized news operation and other personnel from INN filled-in as necessary. WBIN maintained three local reporters who contributed relevant Southern New Hampshire content. All of the broadcasts originated from INN's Davenport studios.  There was no regularly-scheduled sports report. The station maintained additional partnerships with the   (which originally provided headlines through an on-screen ticker), the  , and  .  WBIN indicated plans to further expand its newscast offerings,  including long-range plans for a morning newscast;  Binnie stated his intention to construct ""a public affairs infrastructure that will attract people who are serious about news in New Hampshire."" 
 In addition to  , WBIN-TV sponsored several debates, including a  -moderated     at   on October 11, 2011, in association with Bloomberg and  ,  as well as one gubernatorial and two congressional debates at its Derry studios in partnership with various New Hampshire newspapers and   in October 2012.  The station also aired a daily INN-produced half-hour political newscast,  , at 5 p.m. during the latter portion of the  .  On February 6, 2012, WBIN began airing the syndicated morning show   from 6 to 9 a.m. At the time, the station planned to add a political show to its lineup by 2014. 
 WBIN-TV moved its news operation to the former Walker School in   in 2014 (the remainder of the station's operations remained in Derry), with the school's auditorium being repurposed for debates held by the station. The building, which was acquired by Binnie Media at auction from the   on November 15, 2012, also houses Binnie's Concord radio stations as well as Binnie Media's offices.  WBIN also established bureaus throughout New Hampshire, including   (at a former police station ),  , and  , in addition to Derry and Portsmouth. 
 WBIN-TV ended its INN-produced newscast on April 26, 2013, leaving Kaprielian's forecasts as the only local news content on the station. The station also laid off two of its three reporters.  The cancellation did not impact WBIN's plans for the former Walker School;  Binnie stated in August 2013 that ""it's more important to make a wholesale commitment, which we will do with NH1 Network,""  while Robb Atkinson, WBIN's news director, would subsequently concede that ""we weren't happy with the quality.""  The station debuted a weeknight 90-minute early evening news block at 5 p.m. and a nightly 10 p.m. newscast  on September 15, 2014  under the   branding, based out of the newsroom in the Walker School building in Concord and the Nashua, Derry, Portsmouth, Laconia, and Lebanon news bureaus;  WBIN also produced a weekly magazine program on Sunday mornings,  and the news operation supplies half-hourly newscasts to Binnie Media's radio stations.  While the new newscasts competed against the longer-established WMUR-TV news operation, Lee Kinberg, the executive vice president of  , stated that the newscasts were ""very different from Channel 9,"" and included more coverage of the   compared to WMUR.  WBIN's newscasts also emphasized coverage of politics, with former Nashua   State House reporter Kevin Landrigan serving as chief political correspondent and longtime   political editor Paul Steinhauser becoming  s political director on January 1, 2015;  Atkinson has said that ""We want to own politics in New Hampshire.""  In addition to the weeknight newscasts, the station announced its intention to launch a four-hour morning newscast and an hour-long noon newscast by 2015.  Initially, the 10 p.m. half-hour weekend newscast didn't debut with the news department, but it did launch on October 25, 2014. The first new weekday newscast to launch since the founding of the news operation was  , which debuted on September 21, 2015. 
 WBIN-TV aired its final newscasts on February 16, 2017; the following day, the station laid off most of the news staff concurrent with the announcement of the sale of the station's spectrum in the FCC spectrum auction.  In a statement, Binnie Media said that   would continue operations on radio and online. 
 The station's ATSC 1.0 channel is carried on the   signal of ABC affiliate  :
 WWJE-DT (as WZMY-TV) shut down its analog signal, over   channel 50, on December 1, 2008, which was within the permissible 90-day window prior to the original February 17, 2009, deadline for full-power television stations in the United States to   under federal mandate (this deadline was later moved to June 12, 2009). The station's digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 35,  using   50.
 In 2010, WZMY-TV began broadcasting prime time MyNetworkTV programming in  .
 As WBIN-TV, the station's programming was also seen on three translators in southern New Hampshire. All three stations were owned by New Hampshire 1 Network, Inc., a sister company to Carlisle One Media that previously owned WYCN-CD in Nashua, New Hampshire (now      ); historically co-owned with that station, the three repeaters were not included in a subsequent sale of WYCN.
 All three facilities were  ; the accompanying analog signals left the air on January 3, 2012, to accommodate the construction of these signals.  Since December 28, 2012, the stations were broadcasting under   from a tower at the WBIN studios in Derry while constructing their permanent facilities in order to maintain their broadcast licenses.  All three stations were shut down October 4, 2017, and surrendered their licenses the following day.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Wnds04.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e1/WZMYMNTV.PNG/150px-WZMYMNTV.PNG|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/WBIN50.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/WBIN50-092012.png/220px-WBIN50-092012.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/WBIN50-2.png/125px-WBIN50-2.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/TelevisaUnivision_logo.svg/100px-TelevisaUnivision_logo.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWJE-DT

en.wikipedia.org,Help:Page history - Wikipedia,"A   shows the order in which edits were made to any editable   page, the difference between any two revisions, and a menu of special external tools. A page history is sometimes called   or  .
 You can view a page's history by clicking the ""View history"" tab at the top of the associated page ( ). See   for the mobile version of the site which works differently.
 The page history contains a list of the page's previous revisions, including the date and time—in   by default—of each edit, the   or   of the user who made the change, and an optional   that briefly describes or explains the change. For example, the   for this help page shows it was first created on September 20, 2004, and that it has been changed more than 500 times since then.
 On every ""page history"" page, before the history begins, there are links to several external tools for analyzing or correcting a page. On Wikipedia, these are:
 On a history page:
 Below is a detailed example of a page history using the default skin:
 The edits are listed in chronological order from newest to oldest, and are displayed with each edit being their own row in the list, with each row taking up one line of text. Each entry in the edit history will show the time and date that the edit was applied, the username or   of the contributor who saved the edit, the total size of the resulting page text (in bytes), the net size difference (in bytes) that the changes made from the edit resulted on the page  , the   that was added by the contributor, as well as other technical and diagnostic information.
Let's look at some of the functions of this page:
 Not shown in this example: some edits may be automatically   by the abuse filter (example:  ); any tags applied appear after the edit summary. Tags cannot be added or removed manually, and are intended to help editors identify potential problem edits for examination; they do not   that an edit is problematic.
 Also not shown in this example: you can thank a user for their edit by clicking the Thank button. see  .
 It is possible to restore an old revision of a page by following the link to that revision, clicking ""edit"" and then saving. This should be done with caution, as it means that   changes made to the page since the time of that revision will be undone.
 In rare cases, all or part of a page history entry may be shown in grey, struck out by a horizontal line. This indicates that information has been hidden from public view by an administrator. See   and   for more on this.
 The history page contains a link ""Find addition/removal"". This links to  , a tool for searching the entire history of a given page.
 Another useful tool is the   page, which is used to produce an   file with the wikitext of the current and (optionally) all old revisions of one or more specified pages, with date, time, username, and edit summary. How the XML file is displayed depends on the browser (it can also be saved locally for later searching and analysis). For more information on this feature, see  .
 The following may also be useful:
 Some page histories (such as  ) are very long, so that paging back even 500 results at a time cannot practically reach a date from several years ago. It is possible to simply change the date (YYYYMMDD) in the URL in these cases (  , for example) to get a listing of results going back from that date.
 A link to an Atom   for the history of a page is available from the lefthand  . This gives the   of the last 10 edits, each with a link to the ordinary, full diff page. Depending on the browser there may be possibilities such as sorting by author.
 An RSS version of the feed can be obtained by assigning to   (one of the  ) the value  , i.e., by replacing   with   in the Atom feed link.
 In the mobile version, click ""Last edited"" near the bottom of a page to see the page history. Registered users may also have a ""History"" link or icon   at the top of mobile pages. 
 Other parts of this page describe the desktop version of the site. It looks different from the mobile version and has more interface features. Mobile users can switch to the desktop version by clicking ""Desktop"" at the bottom of any page.
 When a page is   (renamed), the entire edit history of the article, before and after the move, is shown. The old title becomes a   and loses its edit history.
 To view a history of only moves and no other edits, go to   and input the name of the article in the ""target"" field.
 If instead of a move, the entire content was   into a new substitute article, the page history gets spread across two articles. The histories can be   in this case.
 When two pages are merged, typically one becomes a redirect. In this case, the revision history of the redirect is kept.
 When a page is deleted, its revision history remains in the database and can be retrieved by an administrator, who can also undelete the page (see  ).
 Administrators can also remove selected revisions from a page history, for example if they contain defamatory text. For details, see  .
 An ""image"" (in the broad sense of an uploaded file) can be edited, or, more generally, be replaced by a different image, by uploading a new image file with the same name. Again, all revisions are kept. The image history listing forms part of the  , which appears when clicking on the image. The image history consists of this and the old revisions themselves.
 Images which have been deleted from their source are only available to administrators (not to be confused with images removed from an article but not from their source), so the only record available is the upload log, deletion log and possibly the ""votes for deletion"" archive. Only administrators can restore a deleted image without uploading it again.
 It is sometimes useful to link to a specific revision of an article—this is called a "" "". For example, one might have done a review of a Wikipedia article and want to indicate which particular revision was reviewed.
 A permanent link to the current revision of an article is normally available from the sidebar, under Tools ⇒ Permanent link. For other  , or if the revision to be linked to is not the current revision, use the page's History tab to navigate to the specific revision required. The URL here will be suitable for use to permanently reference this revision, and can usually be obtained from the browser's location bar. (See also  .) To make a permalink for use within the English Wikipedia, use  .
 A permalink does not necessarily reproduce the historical revision of the page as it originally appeared. This is because images,   (transcluded text and images), and time-based variables (such as CURRENTTIME) may have changed in the interim; they appear in their current state, not their historical state. Only the on-page text of the article (the wikitext that one sees when clicking 'Edit') is preserved perfectly.
 Those wishing to make use of historical revisions of articles should be aware that some of the history may be problematic.
 As noted at the end of each history revision, in the text at  , the page histories may contain material that is incompatible with our license. Although all contributions are supposed to be compatible with CC BY-SA (except limited, clearly marked fair use material in accordance with our  ), it is possible that a user has inserted something to which they did not have rights to license or which exceeds fair use. The Wikipedia volunteer community has a general policy of removing such copyright problems from publication when they are discovered (see  ), but does not have a general policy of always deleting all such material from the history, particularly if the edit is made to an existing article rather than a new one. In the event of a   takedown notice, the Wikimedia Foundation may remove violating revisions from the page history. In other cases, the revision may be kept to allow proper tracking of authors and demonstrate compliance with all legal requirements. As the Wikimedia Foundation is a not-for-profit company, the volunteer community believes this to be fair use. However, not all revisions in a page history are necessarily available under the CC BY-SA.
 Many revisions from early in Wikipedia's history, almost always from 2001, are missing.   shows the English Wikipedia as it existed on December 20, 2001; its page histories are likewise incomplete, but do sometimes contain revisions absent here (usually edits of little to no consequence).",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Twemoji_1f527.svg/30px-Twemoji_1f527.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Information_icon_dark_green.svg/40px-Information_icon_dark_green.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/View_History-_marked_screenshot.png/250px-View_History-_marked_screenshot.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/MediaWiki_1.21wmf3_page_history_screenshot.svg/900px-MediaWiki_1.21wmf3_page_history_screenshot.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/OOjs_UI_icon_history.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_history.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Permalink.jpg/220px-Permalink.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/44px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Page_history

en.wikipedia.org,Big Muff - Wikipedia,"The  , often known simply as the  , is a ""fuzzbox""   produced in   by the   company, along with their Russian sister company  , primarily for use with the  . It is used by   as well, due to the Big Muff's squeaky frequency response.
 The following is a direct quote from Mike Matthews, Electro-Harmonix founder, and president:
 Back in 1969 I [Electro-Harmonix] was already selling the Muff Fuzz, which was a mild overdrive circuit in an LPB-1 box. I wanted to come out with a three knob distortion unit in a bigger box. I asked my buddy, Bell Labs designer, Bob Myer, to design a unit, one that would have a lot of sustain. When I got the prototype from Bob, I loved the long sustain. This was done by cascading the circuit into additional sections, each one clipped by twin diodes. However, when you clip, the tone can be a bit raspy. So, I spent a couple of days changing capacitors to roll off distortion in the highs, and eventually found that the best long sustaining tone that was a sweet violin-like sound was done by having three capacitors in different parts of the circuit rolling off the rasp. We plunged into production and I brought the very first units up to Henry, the boss at Manny's Music Store on 48th Street, NYC. About a week later, I stopped by Manny's to buy some cables, and Henry yelled out to me, 'Hey Mike, I sold one of those new Big Muffs to  .'  
An earlier Electro-Harmonix pedal, the Axis Fuzz, was also manufactured for the Guild guitar company as the Foxey Lady and used a similar chassis as the early Big Muffs, but had a simpler two-transistor circuit. With the introduction of the Big Muff, the Axis was discontinued and the Foxey Lady pedal became a rebranded Big Muff. It was available at least until the mid-1970s. The Big Muff Pi was the first overwhelming success for Electro-Harmonix's line of pedals. Due to its reliability, its low price and its distinctive sound, the Big Muff sold consistently through the 1970s and was found in innumerable guitarists' pedal collections. For example,   and   were some of first famous users of the pedal. David Gilmour famously used the Big Muff on the   albums   and   and most recently on his 2006   tour. Other artists who used the Big Muff during the 1970s include  ,  ,   (though Zappa had it modified to produce a very non-typical Big Muff distortion), and  . Even after the Electro-Harmonix company was forced out of business in 1982, the pedal remained in such demand that clones of the Big Muff were made by both competing corporations and independent pedal builders, and demand for ""vintage Big Muffs"" rose. Unsurprisingly, when Matthews restarted Electro-Harmonix in the 1990s, the Big Muff was one of the first pedals he reintroduced to the market.
 The ""sustained grind"" of the Big Muff was later an integral part of the sound of many   bands through the 1980s and 1990s, being used extensively by  ,  ,  ,   and  . The name of the pedal even inspired the title of Mudhoney's 1988 debut EP  , as well as  's 1981 instrumental "" "".     and   of   used the   version of the Big Muff,  and, more recently, Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, who often uses the Sovtek version in a number of The Black Keys songs.
Aside from the Big Muff, Electro-Harmonix has made the Nano Muff, the Metal Muff, which has a 3-band EQ and is a distortion; the Little Big Muff, a smaller variation of the current NYC model, the Deluxe Big Muff, the 77/78 op-amp Big Muff, designed by Howard Davis, which uses IC's to create the Fuzz whereas all others, except the Deluxe Big Muff, use transistors. There also exists a customized limited edition Big Muff, called the Mogwai Big Muff.  This pedal was designed for the Scottish band  , and has a slightly more extreme sound. Electro-Harmonix produced only 100 Mogwai Big Muff pedals. In 2017 Electro-Harmonix reissued the Sovtek Big Muff, commonly known as the 'Green Russian' 
 Most versions of the Big Muff use four   stages. The first stage is a clean boost, which drives the next two clipping stages, which create the distortion. The final stage is a tone recovery stage, which recovers volume loss as the   in the Big Muff is passive, and the pedal loses some volume because of this. For a short time in the late-1970s, the Big Muff used  , which at the time were not as highly regarded as the discrete transistor versions. However, the op-amp Big Muffs have lately seen a revival among collectors and players alike. The op-amp Big Muff has a slight variation in sound to the transistor version.
 Electro-Harmonix also released a large-box version of the Big Muff known as the Deluxe Big Muff Pi. This version included an onboard compressor in addition to the standard Big Muff features. It was available in 2 versions: one with a BLEND switch and another with a SERIES/PARALLEL switch. They themselves have joined the fray with a reissue version of their original Big Muff Pi as well as a smaller ""Little Big Muff Pi"", that incorporates true-bypass switching,   components, and a smaller enclosure.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/EHPi.jpg/159px-EHPi.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/49/Ehpijacks.jpg/220px-Ehpijacks.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Deluxe_Bass_Big_Muff_Pi_2020.jpg/220px-Deluxe_Bass_Big_Muff_Pi_2020.jpg|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Muff

en.wikipedia.org,2024 Indian general election in Manipur - Wikipedia,"The   in Manipur will be held on 19 April and 26 April to elect two members of  , from the constituencies of   and  . 
 The 2024 Indian general election got scheduled in the midst of a year-long   in Manipur between the   and   communities, which has seen more than 200 people killed and around 60,000 people displaced. 
The violence resulted in complete geographic separation of the two communities within a month of the onset of violence, with the Meiteis having fled the hill districts and the Kuki-Zo having fled the Imphal Valley. The violence nevertheless continued with arm-toting militias launching attacks on the opposite community and 'village defence volunteers' defending their villages. Over 6,000 guns that had been looted from the state's armouries remain with the militants and other civilian activists. 
 The   constituency, which covers the  , has fielded six candidates, including one from the ruling   (BJP) and one from the opposition   (INC, Congress). 
 The   constituency, which covers the surrounding hill districts and reserved for the state's   (  and  ) communities, only Naga candidates have contested. The Kuki-Zo community decided not to field any candidates. 
The BJP decided to support its   ally  , while the INC fielded a candidate from the Naga community. 
 The leading Meitei militia group,   with 60,000 cadres, announced ""restrictions"" on campaigning on 30 March 2024. It discouraged election campaigns, feasts, the use of loudspeakers, flag raising and election meetings, claiming that such events are more divisive than unifying, and would potentially lead to conflicts and violence. Manipur's state government as well as the central government stayed silent in the face of such impositions. 
 On 19 March, unidentified gunmen opened fire on the Congress Party's Outer Manipur candidate,  , while he was participating in a village-level consultative meeting in the  . The candidate was unhurt. 
On 28 March, the Congress Party's Inner Manipur candidate   was threatened by unidentified miscreants at his home. They gave an ultimatum to his family to send him for a meeting the following day. 
The Congress Party expressed deep concern and requested the police to provide protection to the candidate.  On 14 April, miscreants opened fire at a campaign site in   where Akoijam was expected to organise a campaign meeting the following day. Perceiving the threat, Akoijam cancelled the meeting. 
Two days later, armed miscreants again disrupted an election meeting at  . Akoijam confided to the press the extent of threats he was receiving and commented that these were from ""my own community"" [Meiteis]. 
 A week before the first phase of polling, armed militants, alleged to belong to  , attacked a border region of   in the  , called Phailengmol Island Block, and killed two Kuki-Zo village defence volunteers. Graphic videos of their corpses being dragged, mutilated and body parts displayed were circulated. 
The gruesome attacks and display caused the Kuki-Zo civil society organisations to come out with calls for boycotting the general election, saying ""no justice, no vote"". The Global Kuki-Zomi-Hmar Women Community, including journalists social workers, politicians and leaders, had earlier written to the Chief Election Commissioner, informing him of its decision to boycott the polls. Following the Phailengmol attack, the   and   have also joined the fray. 
On 16 April, the Kuki Inpi Sadar Hills (covering the Kangpokpi district) asked all Kuki residents of the district to abstain from voting. 
Kuki Inpi Churachandpur issued a directive asking its residents to vote against the ruling BJP and its allied partners. 
 The poll for the two Lok Sabha seats of Manipur was scheduled to be held on two days. During the Phase 1 polling on 19 April, it was held for   and three districts ( ,   and  ) of  . During the Phase 2 polling on 26 April, it is to be held in the remaining districts.
 During the Phase 1 polling, several chaotic scenes were witnessed in many parts of the Imphal Valley. 
At Moirang Kampu (in  ), a group of unidentified miscreants arrived in an SUV, had an argument in the polling booth and then fired a few rounds at the people from their vehicle. A 72-year old man was hit by a bullet. The enraged voters then destroyed the polling devices.  Assault and firing was also reported from at least three other locations (Arapati Maning in Imphal East, Wangoo in   and Thamnapokpi in  ).  Several other polling stations in the Valley districts were   by armed miscreants, with video clips flooding the social media. Many fingers were pointed at   militants. In one clip, the Congress candidate Bimol Akoijam is seen complaining to senior police officials about his polling agent having been threatened by armed miscreants and the agent having had to leave the polling station.  The state unit of the Congress party filed a complaint with the chief election officer for the state alleging  , voter intimadion and other irregularities at 36 polling booths in Inner Manipur and 11 polling booths in the   area of Outer Manipur.  The Election Commission ordered a re-poll at 11 polling booths, which was held on 22 April with over 81% voter turnout. 
 In the Outer Manipur constituency, the Kuki-Zo people in the Kangpokpi district were reported to have abstained from voting as per the instructions of Kuki Inpi Sadar Hills. News-reports mentioned empty polling stations with ""complete zero turnout"". 
The election commission reported 22% voter turnout, which is mainly attributed to the Nepali and Naga voters in the district. 
In Churachandpur district, early news-reports mentioned poor turnout, 
but the election commission data at the end of polling showed 64% turnout in the   assembly constituency and 72% in the   assembly constituency, with similar figures in other constituencies. 
The polling agent of   alleged large-scale booth capturing by armed militants in these constituencies, requesting a re-poll from the election commission.

en.wikipedia.org,You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International - Wikipedia,"( ) was a   Christian   that held assemblies (including music concerts and discussions with students) in  . YCRBYCHI's mission statement stated its goal was to ""reshape America by re-directing the current and future generations both morally and   through education, media, and the   values found in our U.S. Constitution."" 
 The ministry received testimonials from school officials and students ""that praise the positive impact the assemblies had by stressing the importance of good choices and using a band to grab attention.""  However, the ministry also attracted controversy for using public school assemblies for religious purposes. Detractors claim the ministry mislead school administrators about the nature of the program and proselytized its views on   and  .  The   designated the organization as an   in March 2012. 
 Founded by Brad Lee Dean in 2008, the organization was based in  .
 In September 2013, the You Can Run headquarters building in Annandale was put up for rent. At the same time, there were reports of departures of the ministry's staff and the disbanding of its street teams. 
 YCRBYCHI was centered on their in-house Christian  -  band Junkyard Prophet,  with founder Brad Lee Dean on drums, Rene Benton on guitar and vocals, Massey Campos on vocals and bass; and Wayne Ruark on lead vocals.  Dean, a survivor of multiple drug overdoses and jail incarcerations, broke into music in the 1980s. He directed Junkyard Prophet's music toward aiding youths overcoming ""trials and tribulations, persecutions, and afflictions....""   Dean's wife, Stephanie Dean, a former commercial actress, joined the band for sexual abstinence-themed songs. 
 The organization held high school assemblies, which began with a one-hour set from Junkyard Prophet, which incorporated a fog machine that frequently set off school fire alarms.  The noise-level of the music led one high school staffer to warn students of permanent hearing loss at a 2005 assembly.   
 After their musical performance, Dean typically gave a lecture where he put forth his views on  , the  ,  ,  , and his belief that  .  During his interactive speech with the assembled students, Dean frequently waded into controversial issues such as  , abortion,  , and  .  
 Dean claimed that ""99.5 percent of everything we do in the assembly is accepted by the kids in an awesome way,"" though he maintained that teachers were more resistant to the organization's message.  
 Reported fees for school programs ranged from $1200 to $5000.  The organization sometimes reduced or waived this fee if schools were unable to pay. A writer traveling with the group detailed instances in which the band's expenses exceeded its income or it has been forced to spend the night sleeping in cars. 
 YCRBYCHI paid to air the radio show  , hosted by Dean and Jake McMillan, on   in Minneapolis and on the Genesis Communication Network.   While still streaming on the GCN website, WWTC canceled the program in May 2011 after the duo aired a lengthy song mocking African Americans.   WWTC's manager, protesting that staff members at his station were neither bigots nor racists, reported that ""the divisive tone"" of the show was objectionable to the ""right spirit"" of conservatism the station sought.   Dean later claimed that the show would reappear on  , a conservative talk station. Though admitting some talks had taken place, KTLK's station manager denied that the show had been signed.   was reinstated on WWTC after a three-month break. 
 In May 2011, Dean was invited to deliver a prayer  in front of the  . He was criticized by members of both parties for the prayer, largely due to the direct references to Jesus and perceived accusations against Democrats and President Obama.  His history of statements against homosexuality, though not part of the prayer, also elicited complaints.  His address was criticized by   (DFL) representative  , who said that the hope of peace during the prayer had been ""crushed by a single person's words."" Majority Leader   and speaker  , both Republicans, also denounced Brad Lee Dean; Zellers said inviting him to speak had been ""a mistake"", and called him ""a man I personally denounce,"" and said, ""I can only ask you for your forgiveness. That type of person will never, ever be allowed on the House floor again."" Representative  , a Republican who had invited Dean to speak in the first place, later apologized for the invitation and compared Dean's position on homosexuality to that of  . Dean was also denounced by the   Catholic Conference and DFL representatives   and  ; Clark called Dean ""a hateful person"".  In June 2011, presidential candidate   was sprayed with   by Minnesota gay-rights activist Rachel E.B. Lang who was upset with Bachmann's support of YCRBYCHI. 
 In April 2012, the Minnesota State College Republican board threatened to revoke the charter of the   chapter of College Republicans if they hosted a speech by Dean on campus. The College Republican group was ""disgusted with the GOP's threats"" and voted unanimously to go ahead with the event as planned. While protest ensued, students stayed to hear Dean speak. They said Dean ""has a strong conservative message. He's pro-constitutional, pro-family, pro-vets and he speaks about the core values of the GOP"". 
 You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International was supported by Minnesota Congresswoman   and Republican gubernatorial candidate  . Emmer's campaign gave the organization $250 in 2008, prompting criticism due to the group's views on homosexuality.  Bachmann has praised the organization, appearing as a keynote speaker at their fundraisers.  Dean has indicated that both Bachmann and Emmer will appear in his upcoming documentary  . 
 YCRBYCHI has been praised by many churches and religious and conservative organizations,  and strongly criticized by civil rights groups and the media, primarily due to its opposition to   and  .
 Proponents, such as former   Supreme Court Chief Justice  , endorsed the program for bringing ""God and His law back to our public school system.""  2004 Presidential Candidate for the Constitution Party,  , visited their Minnesota headquarters and wrote an article regarding his visit with the group on his website, The American View.  Dean was featured in  ,   ,  and  . 
 Critics claimed that the program overstepped its role in schools  and intimidated students.  Some students said that the assemblies presented  -like propaganda that ""encouraged bigotry and hate-mongering"". 
 The organization was at the center of multiple controversies for its school performances, many revolving around its presentation of religious material in public educational settings.  During an assembly at   in 2007, students were shown graphic images of aborted fetuses, and girls were made to chant about being submissive to their husbands. The assembly made students cry and angered parents.   After a 2005 Arkansas assembly, the principal asserted that the group had ""misrepresented"" its ""right-wing message"" and that the group ""won't be back"".   A Wisconsin principal, whose school was visited in 2003, later called a second assembly to apologize to the students for allowing YCRBYCHI a forum for ""brainwashing"" a ""captive audience"".  A Tennessee principal also apologized to students in 2004 ""for any controversy or heartache the assembly generated"". 
 The organization, which didn't mention its aim to evangelize for Christianity in the ""Principal Packet"" it sent to school administrators,  often only revealed their religious leanings during their assemblies.   Dean affirmed that the assemblies were ""used as a tool to have the hearts of the kids opened to receive. the Christian message of hard-hitting truth without compromise"",  though Dean said that school administrators were fully apprised of YCRBYCHI's program prior to the organization's arrival.  However, critics said ""The full religiousness of YCR is not revealed until event staff offer departing students literature directing them to Web sites that make clear the ultra-conservative Protestant nationalism of the ministry."" 
 Additionally, Individuals outside the organization said that ""much of the history that YCRBYCH present is, in fact, either highly sanitized, inaccurate, or demonstrably false."" 
 In 2010, the group's connections to   were highlighted on  ; during the episode,   was critical of statements that Dean made on   about the execution of homosexuals in Muslim countries. The statement, in part, was ""Muslims are calling for the execution of homosexuals in America. They themselves are holding up the laws that are even in the Bible, the Judeo-Christian God but they seem to be more moral than even the American Christians..."". Maddow mentioned Dean's disclaimer on this particular report which said, ""We have never and will never call for the execution of homosexuals.""  In May 2011, Maddow again reported on Dean's statements, this time in connection to Michele Bachmann, a potential presidential candidate at the time. In this report, Maddow did not reference Dean's claim that he did not call for homosexual executions. She instead stated, ""Foreign enemies rising up because Christians are not doing enough to kill the gays,"" and accused Dean and Bachmann of being ""bloodthirsty.""  Dean made numerous statements opposing  -rights, including advocating incarceration of homosexuals and going as far as to state that homosexuality is against the law in the United States. Dean accused the media, specifically MSNBC, as catering to ""progressives, meaning a generally secular, frequently atheist, pro-gay rights, socialist, and big-government market among its viewers."" 
 In response to media coverage, Dean wrote an editorial alleging that his statements were taken out of context,  and produced a video  which sought to rebut the media's reporting on his statements.  Dean claimed her second report prompted death threats.  On July 27, 2011, Dean initiated a defamation lawsuit against  , Maddow, journalist Andy Birkey, and the  , alleging that they intentionally misrepresented Dean's statements in order to advance a "" "", and seeking more than $50,000,000 in damages.   Dean was represented in the case by right-wing attorney  . Dean lost the case in June 2012, and was ordered to pay a total of $24,625.23 to defendants MSNBC & Rachel Maddow.   Dean reacted to this defeat with the claim that  ""Judges are to enforce the law, not to defend lawbreakers and then award them money.""

They included helping students learn to write computer code, personalizing medical treatments for patients, fixing the immigration system he called broken, protecting US children from gun violence, achieving equal pay for equal work in a nod towards gender equality, implementing paid leave, and raising the minimum wage.
 He then took a longer term approach and said he wanted focus on ""the next five years, ten years, and beyond.""  He recognized that the country was in a time of technological change that was having a big impact on people's lives and the planet.  The benefits technology brings to medical science and improving education for remote students were contrasted with the strain disruptive technologies place on working families, and the benefits terrorists gain from access to communication technologies.  He called on America to overcome these fears and face the future with optimism.  He also highlighted America's diversity, strong work ethic, and commitment to rule of law as things necessary to ensure prosperity and security. He stressed that these traits are what got the country through the recent economic crisis, and what led to affordable health care, the resurgence of the US energy sector, greater benefits for troops and veterans and the legal acceptance of Gay marriage.
 He then listed what he called four big questions the country has to answer: 
 He praised the US economy as the strongest in the world, and noted the strong recent job growth, along with a reduction in deficits.  He criticized those who claimed America's economy is in decline, as ""peddling fiction"".  He noted that many jobs are vulnerable, giving workers less leverage, and the ability of jobs to relocate globally adds to the competitive challenge.  He spoke of how this causes companies to be less loyal to communities, and leads to concentration of wealth at the top of the social system.  He also pointed out that the composition of the modern workplace makes it harder for working-class people to succeed.
 He then asked for support for programs to counteract this: ""providing Pre-K for all, offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one, and we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.""  He also asked for steps to make college more affordable, including a proposal to provide two years of community college at no cost for every student.  He also pointed out the importance of savings and benefits for retirement.  He called on strengthening social security and Medicare, and using the Affordable Care Act to cover people in the event of catastrophic health disasters.  In addition to health protection, the President also suggested implementing training programs to help people who lose their jobs find new more modern jobs.  Expanding tax cuts for low income families without children was also discussed.
 He then spoke about the recent failure of the financial system, and pointed out that ""Food Stamp recipients didn’t cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did."" He criticized businesses that avoided their tax bills by creating offshore accounts.  He stressed how he wanted to empower small businesses and spread their best practices across the country.
 He then addressed his second question, how to reignite the spirit of innovation in the country to meet challenges.  He told the story of the Russians beating the US into space, and how that galvanized the US space program, leading to the first moonwalk.  He mentioned the importance of an open Internet and taking steps to get more students and entrepreneurs online.
 He then announced what he called ""a new moonshot"", for America to cure cancer.  A   was announced, with Joe Biden in charge.  The importance of medical research was reiterated, and the topic was shifted to developing clean energy sources.  After criticizing opponents of  , he stressed that even for those who don't believe in global warming, they should embrace ""the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future.""  The success of earlier investments in clean energy such as wind power and solar energy, along with corresponding reductions in foreign oil imports, carbon pollution reductions and the current low price of gas were also highlighted. He asked for an increase in clean energy research, and a push for higher taxes for oil and gas production, to better reflect the cost to the environment of those fuels.  The tax money would be earmarked for building 21st century transportation systems.
 He then addressed the third question, how to ensure America's safety without either becoming isolationist or having to nation-build across the world.  He highlighted the strength of the US military, and criticized those who claimed America was getting weaker as its enemies were getting stronger.  He pointed out that failing states were the biggest threat to the US, not evil empires.  He listed as his top priority ""protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks.""  He discussed the threat of al Qaeda and ISIL, but pointed out that they did not threaten ""our national existence,"" and dismissed claims otherwise as harmful propaganda.  He then detailed the American and 60 country coalition efforts to defeat terrorism and to ""cut off ISIL’s financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, and their weapons. We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.""
 He called on Congress to authorize military force if they were ""serious about winning this war"", but also stated that even without military action the terrorists will not succeed.  He invoked several high-profile captures and killings, including the deaths of Osama bin Laden and the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, and the imprisonment of the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks.  He also addressed the broader threat to world peace, including ""many parts of the world — in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia.""
 To address these challenges, he called for ""a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight.""  He pointed out how that was US strategy in Syria and Iran.  The success in stamping out the recent Ebola epidemic was mentioned.  The President also asked for support ratifying the  , as a way to ""open markets, protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia."" He then highlighted the restoration of diplomatic efforts with Cuba, after fifty years of isolation.  He called on Congress to lift the embargo.
 He then listed a few areas of American leadership: fighting climate change, defending Ukraine, resolving the war in Colombia, feeding the poor in Africa, ending HIV/AIDS and trying to eliminate Malaria.  He reiterated an earlier campaign goal to shut down the prison at Guantanamo, citing the expense and how it is used as a recruiting tool for America's enemies.
 This led to a condemnation of the current climate of bigotry.  He asked that people not be targeted for their race and religion, and instead asked that Americans respect its diversity.  He quoted   “to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.”
 He then invoked the opening words of the constitution, “We the People”, to transition into his fourth and final question, how to fix domestic politics.  He acknowledged that people would not agree on everything and this was due to the size and diversity of the country, and the distributed power structure.  He then called for a willingness to compromise and listen to others, and pointed out that the average person needed to feel as empowered as so-called special interests.
 Obama then stated that one of the few regrets of his presidency was "" that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better. There’s no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I’ll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.""  He pointed out that he felt many of his listeners felt the same way,  and have told him privately that systemic change is needed.  He then mentioned two solutions: ending congressional redistricting to prevent politicians from picking who can vote for them, and implementing campaign finance reform.  He acknowledged that change had to come from the people, not elected officials, and implored people to not give up.  He called on Americans to vote, be heard and remain active in public life.
 He invoked ordinary citizens he sees doing extraordinary and inspirational things, and concluded with ""Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.""

en.wikipedia.org,2016 Republican National Convention - Wikipedia,"The  , in which delegates of the United States   chose the party's nominees for   and   in the  , was held July 18–21, 2016, at Quicken Loans Arena (now  ) in  ,  .  The event marked the third time Cleveland has hosted the   and the first since  .  In addition to determining the party's national  , the convention ratified the  . 
 There were 2,472 delegates to the Republican National Convention, with a simple majority of 1,237 required to win the presidential nomination.  Most of those delegates were bound for the first ballot of the convention based on the results of the  .  On July 19, 2016, the convention formally nominated   for president and     for vice president.  Trump and Pence went on to win the  , defeating the Democratic ticket of   and  . 
 In 2016, both the Democratic and Republican conventions were held   the   instead of after, as was the case in 2008 and 2012. One reason the Republican Party scheduled their convention in July was to help avoid a longer, drawn-out primary battle similar to what happened in 2012, which left the party fractured heading into the general election and eventually led to   losing the election to  . The Democratic Party then followed suit, scheduling their convention in   the week after the Republicans' convention, to provide a quicker response.  On May 3, Republican National Committee chairman   declared   the presumptive nominee after Texas senator   dropped out of the race. The next day, Ohio Governor   suspended his campaign, effectively making Trump the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Trump was the first presidential nominee of a major party since  , the Republican candidate in  , who has held neither political office nor a high military rank prior to his nomination. He was also the first presidential nominee of a major party without political experience since General   first captured the Republican presidential nomination in  . This was the first Republican National Convention to be held entirely in July since  .   and   live streamed the convention via  . 
 On April 2, 2014, the Republican National Committee announced that  ,  ,  ,  ,   and    were the finalists for hosting the convention.  In late June 2014, Cleveland and Dallas were announced as the final two contenders to be the host city.  Cleveland was selected on July 8, 2014. 
 The 2016 Cleveland Host Committee, an Ohio nonprofit corporation with no political affiliation, was the official and federally designated Presidential Convention Host Committee for the convention. It is responsible for ""organizing, hosting and funding"" the convention; it also aims ""to promote Northeast Ohio and ensure Cleveland is best represented, and to lessen the burden of local governments in hosting the 2016 Republican National Convention"".  The Host Committee is composed of prominent Ohio business executives, civic leaders, and other community leaders.  David Gilbert, CEO of   and the Greater Cleveland Sports Commission, is the President and CEO of the host committee.  Organizers have found it hard to raise the money needed to put on the convention, which is normally supported by corporate donations. Corporations that donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the 2012 convention but nothing in 2016 include  ,  ,  ,   and  .  Reluctance to be associated with Trump, or concern that the convention might be disrupted by floor fights or violence, were sometimes cited as factors in the decision to withhold funds.  In July as the convention got under way, the Cleveland Host Committee said it had raised $58 million of its $64 million goal. They asked billionaire  , who often contributes to Republicans, to make up the $6 million shortfall. 
 Quicken Loans Arena was selected in July 2014 as the host site for the 2016 Republican National Convention. The arena hosted the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 election, aired by  , on August 6, 2015. The convention was held July 18–21, 2016. 
 The Cleveland 2016 Host Committee, who ""facilitated construction of the 'cloakroom"" space' for Republican lawmakers, which consisted of an ""exclusive office, lounge and gathering space"" built on the Cleveland Cavaliers practice court, received $923,100 from the Friends of the House 2016 LLC"". Bank records obtained by the   show that  ,  , the  ,  ,  ,  , and other trade and lobby groups ""funded a limited liability company called 'Friends of the House 2016 LLC' to pay for the 'cloakroom.' 
 The convention is designated as a  , meaning that ultimate authority over   goes to the   and  .  A highly publicized   by gun activists to allow the   inside   garnered 45,000 signatures; however, the Secret Service, which is in charge of convention security, announced that it would not allow guns in the arena (or the small ""secure zone"" immediately outside it ) during the event,  releasing a statement in late March 2016 saying: ""Individuals determined to be carrying firearms will not be allowed past a predetermined outer perimeter checkpoint, regardless of whether they possess a ticket to the event.""  The Secret Service has the authority to restrict guns, firearms or other weapons from entering any site where it is protecting an individual. 
 The   received $50 million in federal grants to support local police operations during the event.  With this grant money, the City of Cleveland sought to purchase over 2,000   personnel gear sets prior to the convention for $20 million, and the remaining $30 million was planned to be used for personnel expenses.  Items such as  ,  ,   and coolers have been banned by the City of Cleveland from the 1.7-square-mile ""event zone"" outside the convention hall by the City of Cleveland, but because of a statewide   permitting the open carrying of guns, firearms are permitted.  The Cleveland chapter of the   raised concerns in March 2016 in a letter to city and county leaders about security at the convention, writing that police were unprepared for a ""possible mix of protesters and demonstrators brandishing guns.""  The Cleveland Police Union also raised concerns similar to those raised by the local NAACP in March, writing that equipment and training for police was behind schedule.  On July 16—the eve of the convention—the Cleveland Police Union asked Governor   to temporarily suspend Ohio's state   so as to block the carrying of guns within the event zone,  but Kasich rejected the request, writing: ""Ohio governors do not have the power to arbitrarily suspend federal and state constitutional rights or state laws as suggested."" 
 Before the convention there were a number of online   expeditions that may have been hackers looking for weak spots in the convention's network.  The computer network of the   had already been penetrated by  , compromising, among other things, the database of opposition research on Trump.  On July 17, 2016,   reported that ""Cleveland has assigned about 500 police officers specifically to handle the convention and it has brought in thousands more officers to help, from departments as distant as   and  ."" 
 The   wrote at the end of March 2016 that fears of a turbulent and volatile convention atmosphere were heightened because of a variety of factors: ""a city scarred by controversial police shootings and simmering with racial tension; a candidate [Trump] who has threatened that his supporters will riot if he comes with the most delegates but leaves without the nomination; and a police force with a reputation for brutality.""  Concerns specifically focused on the ability of the   to handle protests in the wake of the   and   cases, and a 2014 Department of Justice investigation that criticized the police department for having a pattern or practice of using ""unreasonable and unnecessary force.""  Left-wing activists have been preparing for the convention since it was announced in 2014.  In May 2016, the   threatened to file a lawsuit on behalf of two activist groups, Citizens for Trump and a progressive group called Organize Ohio, asserting that protesters were being inhibited in their attempts to organize effectively by the city's delay in granting permits.  As of May 19, six groups had filed for permits, but none had been granted. Cleveland stalled on approving and making public the demonstration applications it received, while Philadelphia (hosting the  ) had already granted an application.  The ACLU sued the city in   on June 14, 2016.  As of May 20, 2016, groups that have filed for protest permits have included the  ;  ; Organize Ohio, a group of progressive activists; the Citizens for Trump/Our Votes Matter March; Coalition to March on the RNC and Dump Trump; Stand Together Against Trump, an anti-Donald Trump group; People's Fightback Center/March Against Racism; and Created Equal, an  . A pro-Trump group, Trump March RNC, withdrew its application after Trump became the presumptive nominee. 
 As Trump rose to become the presumptive presidential nominee of the Republican Party, a number of prominent Republicans announced they would not attend the convention.  Of the living former Republican nominees for president, only 1996 nominee   announced that he would attend the convention; Romney,  ,   and   all announced that they would skip the convention.  A number of Republican  ,   and  , particularly those facing difficult reelection campaigns, also indicated that they would not attend, seeking to distance themselves from Trump and spend more time with voters in their home states.  Most notably, Governor Kasich chose to avoid the convention, while Ohio     attended the convention but avoided taking a major role in its proceedings.  On July 8, 2016,   Senator   announced that he would not attend the convention.  Many Republican senators did not attend the convention at all:  Senator   of  , who would be ""  with his wife""; Senator   of  , who said he had ""to mow his lawn""; and Senator   of  , who would be traveling in Alaska by  . 
 
A number of prominent businesses and trade groups, including  ,   and  , scaled back participation in the convention, sharply reducing their contributions for convention events and sponsorship.  In June, six major companies that sponsored the 2012 Republican convention— ,  ,  ,  ,   and  —announced they would not sponsor the 2016 Republican convention.    followed suit, announcing that it, too, would be withdrawing funding from the convention over Trump's position on certain election issues. 
 Seating arrangements for state and territorial delegations were announced on July 16, two days before the convention began.  The Ohio and Texas delegations were assigned to the back of the convention hall, a move viewed as punishment for the delegations, as they did not back Trump in their respective primaries (Ohio and Texas voted for Kasich and Cruz, respectively). 
 There are four Convention committees, which met ahead of the convention for specific purposes under the rules of the Republican Party.  Each committee is composed of one man and one woman from each state, the five U.S. territories, and the  , totaling 112 members. Those committee members are selected by the 56 delegations, which determine on their own how to choose their representatives on each committee.  Each of the committees met the week before the convention at the Huntington Convention Center in Cleveland.  The committees are as follows:
 The Rules Committee, which sets the rules of the convention and the standing rules that govern the party until the next convention, met on July 14. The rules it passes must be adopted by the full convention to take effect. This committee is regarded as the most powerful. It consists of 112 members, including one male delegate and one female delegate from each state, territory and Washington, D.C. Members of this committee are elected at state conventions.  The Rules Committee was chaired by   of   and Ron Kaufman of  . 
 In June 2016, activists   and   formed a group called  , which   described as ""an effort to convince delegates that they have the authority and the ability to vote for whomever they want.""   Republican delegate Kendal Unruh led an effort among other Republican delegates to change the convention rules ""to include a 'conscience clause' that would allow delegates bound to Trump to vote against him, even on the first ballot at the July convention.""  Following a ""marathon 15-hour meeting"" on July 14, 2016, the Rules Committee voted down, by a vote of 84–21, a move to send a ""minority report"" to the floor allowing the unbinding of delegates, thereby guaranteeing Trump's nomination. The committee then made the opposite move, voting 87–12 to include rules language specifically stating that delegates were required to vote based on their states' primary and caucus results.  By a unanimous vote, the Rules Committee also voted to change Rule 40(b), a controversial rule that had provided that ""a candidate had to win a majority of the vote in eight states to have his or her name placed into nomination at the convention.""  The committee voted to return to the pre-2012 rule, which required a candidate to receive only a plurality of the vote in at least five states to have his or her name placed in nomination. 
 The Platform Committee met for two days of open hearings on July 11 and 12  to draft a  , which had to be ratified by the full convention. (See   below).  The Platform Committee was chaired by Senator   of   and co-chaired by Congresswoman   of   and     of  . 
 The Credentials Committee handles disputes on the eligibility of convention delegates. The Committee on Contests reviews contested delegates; if the Contests Committee recommends that a delegate be de-certified, the Credentials Committee considers the recommendation.  The Rule Committee was chaired by  , former chairman of the Republican National Committee, and co-chaired by   chairman Doyle Webb. 
 The Committee on Arrangements handles the scheduling and logistics of the convention.  The committee was chaired by Steve King, former chairman of the  . 
 On July 12, 2016, the Republican Platform Committee completed work on a draft of the party's 2016 platform.  The draft platform was described as ""very conservative""  and reflective of the party's move towards the right. 
 On domestic policy, the draft platform opposed abortion without exceptions.  The platform committee adopted a provision, proposed by    , expressing opposition to any restriction on  .  The platform called for ""certain  "" to be immediately transferred to state ownership where they could be  . The platform did not specify whether the lands would include  ,  , or  .  The platform called   ""a public health crisis that is destroying the life of millions"" and encouraged states to fight it.  The platform also called for the teaching of the   in public schools. 
 On foreign policy, the members of the platform committee were split between "" -minded  "" and ""national security  .""  The latter camp won on almost every point, voting down measures that would have condemned ongoing U.S. involvement in Middle Eastern wars and approving language promoting increased military spending.  One plank reflected a more isolationist approach, eliminating references to giving weapons to   in its fight with   and  ; the removal of this language reportedly resulted from intervention from staffers to presumptive Republican presidential nominee  .  The draft platform opposed a   to the  .  While the 2012 Republican platform called for passage of the   (TPP), the draft 2016 platform did not mention the agreement; this omission reflected the influence of Trump, who opposed the trade pact.  The draft platform expressly echoed Trump's call for a wall to be built on the  . 
 The most contentious discussions held by the platform committee were discussions of social issues, particularly issues of sexuality and gender.  The draft platform took a traditionalist view on social issues, criticizing ""how the modern American family has evolved"".  Many platform planks expressing ""disapproval of  ,   or  ""—championed by  , the president of the  —passed.  The draft platform called for overturning  , the Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriage, by a  .  The platform also called for the appointment of judges ""who respect traditional family values"".  The draft platform promoted state legislation to limit restroom access to persons of the same biological sex. It also stated that ""natural marriage"" is between a man and a woman, asserting that such unions are best for children.  The draft platform also expressed support for allowing parents to seek ""the proper medical treatment and therapy for their minor children""; this language was believed to allude to parental freedom to engage in   with their minor children. 
 Rachel Hoff, a   delegate who is the first openly gay member of a Republican platform committee, offered several pro-LGBT platform amendments. Each proposal failed.   Hoff's proposal for language ""stating that marriage is a fundamentally important institution and that 'there are diverse and sincerely held views on marriage' within the party"" failed in an unofficial vote of 30 to 82.  An amendment was also offered to recognize that gay people are targeted by  ; the delegates who introduced this amendment sought to signal inclusion of the gay community. The amendment was opposed by conservative delegates (such as   of Indiana, who termed such an amendment ""identity politics"") and was voted down. 
 The 2016 Republican Party platform submitted by the Platform Committee was adopted by the Convention on July 18, 2016. 
 Giovanni Cicione of  , a platform committee member, led ""a dissident group of Republican delegates"" who opposed the provisions of the draft platform relating to sexuality and gender and sought to replace the entire platform with a two-page ""statement of principles"" that avoided controversial issues like same-sex marriage.  Cicione tried to force a debate and vote on the platform from the   of the convention.  Cicione's effort was unsuccessful; the delegates approved the platform by voice vote, with only a few scattered ""nays"" audible. 
 After the Indiana primary on May 3, 2016,   became the presumptive nominee as the lone remaining   running for the  . Under rules established by previous Republican conventions, most delegates were bound on the first ballot according to the results of the primaries.  A simple majority of 1,237 delegates was needed to win the nomination.  Entering the convention, Trump was seen as the presumptive nominee and had the support of a comfortable majority of the delegates. 
 On the afternoon of July 18, 2016, a group of delegates sought to force a roll-call vote on the proposed convention rules package adopted by the Rules Committee.  Some who demanded a roll call vote sought to change the party rules package to ""unbind"" delegates so that on the first ballot, delegates could ""vote their conscience"" and conceivably block Trump from being nominated on the first ballot; such a move would also ""allow Trump opponents a platform to argue against"" Trump.  Others demanding a roll call vote were seeking to reform party rules to decentralize power from the RNC and make changes for the 2020 primary process. 
 That morning, a petition for a roll call vote was submitted with the signatures of a majority of delegates from ten states.  That afternoon, the Presiding Officer, Rep.   of Arkansas, did not recognize delegates clamoring for recognition over the rules package for the convention. Womack first declared the   was ordered by   despite loud cries of objection. The rules were then adopted by  , prompting loud cries of protest from delegates demanding recognition for a roll-call vote.  Finally, Womack declared that a   was   by unanimous consent, again to cries of objection. With loud cries throughout the convention hall, Womack abandoned the podium for several minutes, allowing RNC and Trump whips to work the floor and collect withdrawal signatures from the petition for a roll call vote.  Womack then reappeared and, again using unanimous consent, stated he would put the question of adopting the rules to the convention for a voice vote a second time. A second voice vote was taken. Womack then recognized the leader of the Utah delegation, who requested a roll call vote. Womack denied the motion, ruling that there were insufficient signatures to compel such a vote,  and announcing that while there had initially appeared to be nine state delegations that agreed to the roll-call vote, enough signatures had since been withdrawn to cause three states to fall below the threshold, thus missing the required seven states needed.  It was reported that Trump campaign aides and RNC staff worked on the floor to persuade delegates to withdraw their support and ""challenged the validity of various signatures.""  Delegates, including Senator   of Utah, sought recognition and repeatedly called for a  ,  but were ignored by Womack, and reportedly had their microphones turned off.  Lee said he had ""never seen anything like this"" after Womack declined to recognize their objections and walked off the stage,  and  , the Virginia delegation chairman, said the RNC ""cheated"" and ""violate[d] their own rules.""  The process prompted the Colorado delegation to walk out in protest. 
 ,   from  , formally nominated Trump for president,  with  ,   from  , and  ,  , seconding the nomination.  Trump won the presidential nomination on July 19, 2016  on the first ballot with 69.8% of the delegates, the lowest percentage of delegates won by the Republican nominee since the  .  The vice presidential nomination was held immediately after the presidential nomination.  , the  , nominated Indiana governor   for vice president.  Trump had announced his   of Pence as his preferred running mate the weekend before the start of the convention.  Pence won the vice presidential nomination by acclamation. 
 All of the delegates from Iowa, Alaska, Utah and the District of Columbia were recorded and counted for Trump, despite the fact that Trump lost all three contests, and most of the members of those delegations had voted for other candidates. The Alaska delegation challenged the award of votes to Trump by the RNC Secretary and the Utah delegation booed when its delegates were awarded to Trump, but was reminded by the RNC Chairman that the rules for these two states required the votes to be awarded to whichever candidate was still in the race for the RNC Nomination for President, and that Cruz, Rubio, and the other candidates that had withdrawn from the race had forfeited these delegates based on the RNC nomination rules. 
 In April 2016, Trump vowed to bring ""some  "" to the convention, criticizing the party's  , as ""the single most boring convention I've ever seen.""  The convention's lineup of speakers lacked ""many of the party's rising stars"" and rather featured some of Trump's ""eclectic collection of friends, celebrities and relatives.""     reported that Trump was directly involved in details of convention plans, seeking ""to maximize the drama and spectacle"" of the four-night event.  A large number of prominent Republican elected officials said they were not interested in attending the convention or even speaking at it, seeking to distance themselves from Trump.  The Trump campaign considered the idea of having Trump speak all four nights at the convention – a break from the traditional practice of the presidential nominee taking the stage only on the final night of the convention.  Ultimately, Trump decided not to speak every night.  Trump also initially stated that he would announce his vice-presidential running mate at the convention itself, rather than before the convention,  with a campaign staffer saying that ""announcing the vice-presidential nominee before the convention is like announcing the winner of   before the final episode is on the air.""  Trump's campaign eventually announced plans to announce a running mate the week before the convention  and named   as his running mate on July 15, 2016. 
 A number of figures that Trump said he would invite to speak, including boxing promoter  , former     and   quarterback  , were not included in the lineup.  Trump wanted King to speak at the convention and raised the issue several times, reportedly until Republican National Committee chairman   ""firmly explained"" to Trump that King should not be invited due to his past   conviction.  Former   coach  , a Trump supporter, declined an invitation to speak.  An early roster of speakers obtained by the media listed former   quarterback   as a speaker, but Tebow later dismissed this as a rumor and did not appear at the convention.   , a prominent   rabbi, was initially set to appear at the convention to deliver the opening prayer (having accepted an invitation to do so from  , a congregant), but after hundreds of American   urged him to withdraw from the convention, Lookstein pulled out. 
 Trump sought to bar those who have not endorsed him from addressing the convention, making comments aimed at the former primary rivals who have declined to endorse him – Bush,  ,   and  .  However, both Senator   of Florida and Senator   of Texas, who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination and lost, were eventually placed on the speakers' schedule, although ""neither ... paid the expected price of that spotlight by offering an explicit endorsement.""  Cruz met with Trump two weeks before the convention and accepted an invitation to speak.  Rubio was initially not offered a speaking slot and was expected to skip the convention,  but on July 17, 2016, it was confirmed that Rubio would address the convention via recorded video.  Neither Rubio nor Cruz were listed as ""headliner"" speakers. 
 Governor Kasich did not enter the convention hall or speak at the convention, despite overtures from Trump allies Priebus and   – who, along with  , lost the running mate job to Pence – and top Trump campaign advisor  .  Kasich said: ""If I'm going to show up at the convention and I'm not going to be saying all these great things about the host, then I think it's inappropriate. I don't think that's the right thing to do."" Kasich attended events outside the convention hall in support of down-ballot Republican candidates.  As the convention began, the Trump campaign lashed out at Kasich for his failure to endorse, prompting an exchange that   called ""remarkably bitter"" and ""the latest extraordinary turn in a campaign that has veered sharply away from political precedent.""  Manafort called Kasich ""petulant"" and accused him of ""embarrassing his party,"" prompting Kasich chief political aide   to mock Trump and criticize Manafort for his work on behalf of foreign ""thugs and autocrats"" abroad. 
 On July 17, 2016, the convention planners released the convention's official schedule of events and speakers, along with themes.  (An early, preliminary roster of speakers, ""confirmed by two people with direct knowledge of the convention planning,"" had been obtained and published by the   several days earlier.)  The schedule of speakers is as follows:

 Of the 19 speakers billed as ""headliners,"" six are members of the Trump family: Trump himself, his wife Melania and four of his children, Ivanka, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany. 
 These speeches received a significant amount of media attention.
  From a young age, my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life: that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise; that you treat people with respect. ""
 Melania Trump's speech  ""almost immediately came under scrutiny when striking similarities were discovered between her speech"" and  's speech at the  .  The Trump campaign at first denied allegations of  .  Campaign manager Paul Manafort argued that the speech contained ""not that many similarities"" and the words used are not unique words ""that belong to the Obamas."" 
 Following Trump's speech,   Jarrett Hill was the first to report that the speech had large similarities.  Later, Chris Harrick, Vice President of Marketing at the plagiarism prevention service  , later reported that Trump used about 6% of Michelle Obama's words and found two types of plagiarism, ""clone"" and ""find and replace"".  Various media outlets suggested that members of   should respond to the accusations, which they did a few hours after the speech in the form of the following statement by the campaign's senior communications advisor,  : ""In writing [the] speech, Melania's team of writers took notes on her life's inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking. Melania's immigrant experience and love for America shone through in her speech, which made it a success."" 
 , chairman of the  , described the speech as ""inspirational"" but said if plagiarism were found, he thought ""it certainly seems reasonable"" to fire the person who wrote the speech.   , Donald Trump's campaign chairman, called it a ""great speech"" and said ""obviously Michelle Obama feels very similar sentiments toward her family"". He later said ""to think that she would be cribbing Michelle Obama's words is crazy"", adding ""This is once again an example of when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton, she seeks out to demean her and take her down. It's not going to work against Melania Trump.""  Sean Spicer, director of communications for the Republican National Committee, defended the speech by saying that similar statements have existed before her speech such as quotes by  ,  , and   from  . 
 David Lauter of the   stated that while these allegations are unlikely to cost Trump votes, the distraction is unhelpful, referring to it as a ""lost opportunity"" for the campaign. 
 On July 20, 2016, the Trump campaign issued a statement by   which included the following:
 In working with Melania on her recent first lady speech, we discussed many people who inspired her and messages she wanted to share with the American people. A person she has always liked is Michelle Obama. Over the phone, she read me some passages from Mrs. Obama's speech as examples. I wrote them down and later included some of the phrasing in the draft that ultimately became the final speech. 
 On July 20, two days after Melania's speech, McIver wrote that Donald Trump declined her offer to resign. 
 In the second night of the convention, Governor   gave a speech in a style of a  . After a series of accusations against Hillary Clinton to which his audience responded ""guilty"", the crowd chanted ""lock her up"". The crowd's reaction has received widespread coverage following the speech.  The ""lock her up"" chant was later uttered by supporters of   before the 2016 Democratic National Convention.   Clinton responded to the chant in an interview on   by saying that it saddened her. 
  If you love our country, and love our children as much as you do, stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom, and to be faithful to the constitution."" 
 In the third night of the convention, Senator   of Texas gave a speech in which he did not endorse Trump for president, and instead urged listeners to ""vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution.""  Pro-Trump delegates were enraged at Cruz's speech, shouting him down and booing him off the stage,  in what was described by the   as ""the most electric moment of the convention.""  Convention security personnel and Cruz advisor   escorted Cruz's wife   out of the hall, fearing for her safety.    spoke after Cruz and said: ""I had the text of what Ted Cruz was gonna say, and I thought it was funny,"" Gingrich said. ""I mean, Ted gets up and he says, 'Look, vote your conscience for someone who will support the Constitution.' Well, in this particular election year, that by definition cannot be for Hillary Clinton.""  The following morning, Cruz attended a contentious meeting with delegates representing Texas that resulted in what   labeled ""a remarkable 25-minute back-and-forth with his own constituents, defying appeals from his own Texas delegation to put the party above his inhibitions and back Trump."" 
 Cruz's speech sparked a backlash  and elicited negative reactions from prominent Republicans supporting Trump.  New Jersey governor and former presidential candidate   called the speech ""awful"" and ""selfish.""  New York Representative   called Cruz a ""fraud"" and a ""self-centered liar.""  Senator   of Indiana responded that Cruz was a ""self-centered, narcissistic, pathological liar.""  Representative   of Tennessee, when asked about Cruz's speech, responded that she ""would tell [Cruz] the same thing I would tell my kids, 'get over yourself.'""   , chair of the  , confronted Cruz after his speech and labeled Cruz a ""traitor to the party.""  In addition, Cruz was denied entry to influential Republican donor  's suite at the convention.  Conservative radio host   speculated that Cruz was trying to mimic  's speech at the  , in that ""he wanted to deliver a speech that was Reaganesque in that the delegates would walk out of there thinking that they should have nominated him. He didn't get there."" Instead, Limbaugh compared his speech to  's at the  , in which he failed to endorse President  , the nominee, by putting his own interests ahead of the interests of the party.  According to CNN, in the wake of Cruz's non-endorsement of Trump at the RNC, his critics believe that an intraparty challenge could be possible. GOP donors and Texas politicians have asked Representative   to run against him in the next cycle's Texas primary in 2018. McCaul, a representative for six terms and chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, has not yet made a decision but likewise has not yet ruled out a possible Senate run.  Later, on September 23, 2016, Cruz publicly endorsed Trump for president. 
  Instead of going to Mars, we invaded the Middle East. … It's time to end the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country. When I was a kid, the great debate was about how to defeat the Soviet Union, and we won. Now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom. This is a distraction from our real problems. Who cares? 
 , a billionaire   co-founder and   investor, delivered a manifesto for tackling the greater issues of the day, focusing on technology, the economy and small government. 
Thiel also affirmed his pride to be ""gay, a Republican and most of all an American"", a stance that earned him a standing ovation, chanting ""USA!"".  It was the first time in the history of Republican National Conventions that a speaker identified himself as gay in his speech, although there have been previous speeches by gay men. 
 Trump, having been formally nominated as the Republican presidential nominee on the second night of the convention, spoke on the fourth and final night of the convention. Trump's speech was leaked hours in advance by  , a liberal-leaning  , though Trump had already given copies of his speech to the network press pool.  Trump's daughter,  , introduced Trump in a speech immediately before his own speech.  "" "" was used as the entrance music for Ivanka Trump. The   estate complained about the use of this song, which his family said was ""offensive and against the wishes of the George Harrison estate."" 
 Trump spoke for 75 minutes, making his speech the longest since at least the   and one of the longest acceptance speeches ever in major-party convention history.   In his speech, Trump stated that America faces a ""crisis"" due to ""attacks on our police"" and ""terrorism in our cities,"" and emphasized an important theme in his campaign:  .  In evaluating the speech, Glenn Thrush of   noted the influence of  ,  ,  , and  , all of whom sounded similar themes earlier in American history in attempts to win over the "" "".  Trump also promised to limit American participation in global crises and trade deals.  When Trump turned to the subject of  , many in the audience began shouting ""Build the wall, build the wall,"" referring to a signature promise of Trump's campaign to   on the  .  Trump also repeatedly attacked President   and the Democratic presumptive nominee,  , arguing that the country and world had become less safe during their time in office.  However, Trump attempted to reach out to supporters of defeated Democratic candidate  , as well as down-and-out urbanites.  In his speech, Trump also became the first Republican nominee to mention the LGBT community in a GOP nomination address, saying, ""As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology."" 
 Philip Rucker and   of   found Trump's speech to be ""relentlessly gloomy,"" and observed that Trump painted himself as an agent of change, while he cast Clinton as a defender of the status quo.  Trump's speech was dubbed the ""Mourning in America"" speech.  Niall Stanage of   argued that Trump's speech brought stability to a turbulent convention and showed Trump at his ""most comfortable and energized.""  A   poll found largely positive reactions among ""GOP political insiders"" while Democrats argued that Trump's ""dark"" speech would prove damaging.    released a cover story the next day by Michael Goodwin praising Trump's speech, declaring it ""the speech of his life,"" and also saying that the speech ""could signal the start of an American revival.""  Ratings figures released by the major networks showed that approximately 32 million viewers watched Trump's speech, slightly ahead of the number that watched  's 2012 speech. 
 Some LGBT advocates critiqued Trump's reference to LGBT people, on the ground that it stood in contrast to positions he had taken on LGBT issues during the campaign; activists such as   of the   and Rick Zbur of   suggested that the statement was an attempt to turn LGBT people against Muslims and pit minority groups against each other. 
 A   survey found that 35% of Americans saw Trump's speech positively (either ""excellent"" or ""good""), while 36% saw it negatively.  According to Gallup, the speech had ""the least positive reviews of any speech we have tested after the fact.""  36% of Americans said the convention made them more likely to vote for Trump, while 51% said it made them less likely to vote for him. This is the highest ""less likely to vote"" percentage for a candidate in the 15 times Gallup has asked this question after a convention.  It is also the first time in Gallup's convention polling that a Democratic or Republican convention has made more say that they are less likely to vote for the party's nominee. 
 According to a CNN/ORC poll, the public rendered a split decision on whether the convention made them more or less likely to back Trump, with 42% saying more likely while 44% saying less so.  40% called the speech ""excellent or good,"" and about half of voters (45%) said Trump's speech reflected the way they feel about things in the U.S. today.  However, some negative numbers included the fact that 18% called Trump's speech ""terrible,"" which was the highest number recorded in that category by CNN since it first started to ask the question in 1996. 
 According to FiveThirtyEight, poll averages suggested a post-convention bounce of 3 to 4 percentage points for Trump. 
 The number of demonstrators was significantly lower than expected and, according to Cleveland records, three of five officially permitted protests planned for the first three days of the convention did not occur. Lower-than-expected was attributed to a variety of factors, including ""fear of violence from the police and fear of violence from the Trump supporters""; Cleveland's relatively small size compared to cities such as Chicago or New York; and a heavy police presence. 
 On July 18, the convention's first day, dueling anti-Trump and pro-Trump demonstrations took place at various places in Cleveland, attracting several hundred demonstrators each. The demonstrations were peaceful,  with just two reported arrests. 
 On July 19, the convention's second day, peaceful protests continued. Demonstrators included those from groups such as the antiwar organization   and from the West Ohio Minutemen, a  .  Three people were arrested for   for climbing flag poles and hanging a banner at the  , bringing the total number of convention-related arrests to five.  A brief scuffle between supporters of pro-Trump     and anti-Trump protesters was quickly broken up by police.  On July 21, the final day of the convention, Jones and   interrupted a broadcast of  's  , leading to a confrontation between Jones, Stone, and Uygur. 
 On July 20, the convention's third day, seventeen people were arrested, and two officers sustained minor injuries. The   reported: ""News reports and videos circulated on social media about the increasingly tense nature of protests that have included activists from  , the   and the  , in addition to ardent supporters for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton."" 
 On July 21, the final day of the convention, Donald Trump's acceptance speech was briefly interrupted by Code Pink activist  .

en.wikipedia.org,Murder at the Vanities - Wikipedia,"is a 1934 American     based on the 1933 Broadway show with music by  . It was released by  . It was directed by  , stars  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .   and His Orchestra are featured in the elaborate ""Ebony Rhapsody"" number.
 The film is primarily a musical, based on  's long-running      , combined with a murder mystery. Songs featured in the film by   and   include "" "" sung by Brisson, ""Sweet Marijuana"" sung by Michael, ""Where Do They Come From (and Where Do They Go)"" sung by Carlisle, and ""Ebony Rhapsody"" performed by Duke Ellington and His Orchestra and sung by Michael. In the film,  ,  , and   had small roles as  . It was released on DVD (as part of a six-disc set entitled ""Pre-Code Hollywood Collection"") on April 7, 2009.
 Jack Ellery (Oakie) is staging a lavish musical revue, starring Eric Lander (Brisson), Ann Ware (Carlisle), and Rita Ross (Michael), supported by a cast of a hundred background singers/dancers (almost all women, and many scantily clad) and two full orchestras. On opening night, just before the show, somebody tries to kill Ware several times. Ellery calls in police lieutenant Murdock (McLaglen) of the homicide squad to investigate. During the show a private detective and then Rita are murdered. Ellery hides this from the rest of the performers, claiming the victims are just sick, and talks Murdock into investigating while the revue continues on, otherwise Ellery will go broke.
 Several twists and turns follow, but finally the murders are solved just after the show ends. In the last scene, Nancy (Wing), a squeaky pretty blonde showgirl, finally gets to tell Ellery and Murdock what she has attempted to tell Ellery several times throughout the show. However, he kept putting her off, she was just trying to gain his attention, and he was too busy staging the show. She actually had a vital piece of information that would have solved the first murder much sooner, and might have prevented the second murder. Now that the show is over and a success, Ellery's attention is finally on her, and they go out for the night to celebrate. She giggles once again and moves off   in front of him, and then Oakie breaks the   just momentarily, looking into the camera with a devilish grin, before he follows her.
 The film was a box office disappointment for Paramount.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/Poster_from_1934%27s_Murder_at_the_Vanities.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_at_the_Vanities

en.wikipedia.org,Wikipedia:WikiProject Linguistics/SFL - Wikipedia,"Welcome to the  ! We are a group of editors dedicated to improving the coverage on Wikipedia of   which has grown into a significant area since the 1970s, with precursors earlier that century. The field has had a major influence on linguistics research and teaching at universities and on school curricula in parts of the English-speaking world. Semiotic in its orientation and geared towards the analysis of spoken and written discourse, it is pursued almost entirely in relation to English (with more recent offshoots in other languages).
 SFL has had very patchy coverage on en.WP, despite its prominence as a field of modern linguistics. This task-force page is a first attempt to provide professionals and students with a hub to coordinate their work to build this topic on the English Wikipedia.
 Tony1 has volunteered to be the janitor, as it were, to ensure that the induction of SFL professionals and students who register as en.WP editors is smooth, and that they have someone to go to with questions about WP's rather complex policies, guidelines, and procedures. But it is up to the professionals to take the reigns beyond this, since he is only an amateur linguist. Please edit this page as you wish. Click   at the top-left to say anything you like!
 Many more articles need to be created, and the existing ones need expansion, editing, and cleaning up. An   has been created for easier navigation around SFL-related articles, for both readers and editors.

 Hi, 
 We have about a hundred IPA templates, for different languages, which accept a sound file as a parameter. They're identical in this part, so I thought I'd try spinning it off as a nested template. However, I cannot get the file name to pass. 
 {{ }} is an example. The 'if {{{3}}}' part is for the audio file. I've tried a few things on a test page {{ }}, trying to pass {{{3}}} to {{ }}. What am I missing? 
 Thanks, —   ( ) 21:52, 3 June 2011 (UTC) 
 The basic usage examples use {{ }} as a demonstration. As {{ }} has been marked for deletion, this makes the section difficult to follow (and a little too meta) for a new user like me.   ( ) 00:23, 13 August 2011 (UTC) 
 Template scripts are difficult to read and the  behavior is hard to predict. Code written in it are often brittle. Yet there is no playground made available to users for testing templates before deployment. This results in people keeping around poorly programmed templates out of fear of the ramifications of editing. IMHO this is an aspect that is fundamentally broken right now. --  ( ) 03:10, 24 August 2011 (UTC) 
 While using the templates, if any values are unused then the template shows the variable itself like
 I was wondering if we could avoid showing the variable and make it look like the one below.
 
 Thank you. I have created many templates already so I dont think I will start with infobox again. Also, I could not figure out the if function but I was able to use this code.
 Although this still shows the string ""Defunct Promotions"", the variable is blank and it looks better.
 It would be even better if you could give an example of the if function.
Thank you.
 When templates automatically include a page that uses them into some category, I have found that this can often cause trouble. Sometimes people use templates in User spaces pages, which then causes these userspace pages to be included in the encyclopedia categories. Sometimes people also explicitly use code to include a page into a category. This can be very confusing when you are trying to remove a page from a category because you delete the category yet the page remains in the category. It can take a while to figure out. In general, I think the practice of auto-including pages into categories is a poor one. Mainly because it destroys the conceptual simplicity of a template as the template can now have ""non-obvious"" unintended effects. After a period for comments, I will add a sentence about this to this help article.   ( ) 17:14, 13 September 2011 (UTC) 
 I used {{ }} to create {{ }}. They are putting the first year of the century in the wrong century. Is it a fault with the code? Can it be fixed? --   ( ) - 07:02, 21 January 2012 (UTC) 
 Hi. Now, I know that when using any template, e.g.  , one can type either {{Reflist}} or {{reflist}}. The main   page states that either works. 
 But I'm a stickler for standardisation, so I'd like guidance as to which case people consider better. 
 Has this been discussed before, does anybody know? Many may say it's too trivial to discuss. Fine, but do others have a view?

 I'd like to auto-categorize language infoboxes for maintenance when the data is more than 30 years old. (In that time the figure could easily double, or the language could go extinct.) I'm adding a date parameter to encourage better coverage, but the problem is that it will very often be more than just a numerical year. It could be a span, say 1987–1993 (if data from various countries are not all from the same year), or could have a comment like 'decreasing' or 'census', or include a ref or fn. If I can truncate the string to the first 4 digits, then I'll have a numeric input that I can use. However, the only way I know how to truncate is with #sub, and I don't think I can feed a parameter into that: it treats it as a raw string. So,
 produces an error, whereas
 works fine so long as 'speakersdate' is purely numeric.
 Can anyone think of a workaround? 
 Thanks. —   ( ) 07:57, 12 November 2011 (UTC) 
 I'm working on the wikibooks site and I have dozens of examples where I want to pass a table as a parameter to a template.

 Hi, I have been having an issue with my infobox template. When I make a header for a section in my infobox template (e.g.  
|- 
! colspan=""2"" style=""background-color:#C0C0C0; color:black;"" |Measurements 
|- 
) it works fine, and appears. But if I use the infobox for a character who doesn't have info for a section (e.g. no measurements were provided), the section header appears anyways, even though nothing is under it. I found a page on another wiki that has a template that does the same sort of thing mine does. My template would look kind of like  , if I use it for a character who doesn't have the info supplied. you see, the appearence section should appear, since there is info there. But, there are no stats, but the section header still appears. Is there a way to hide it? So that the template doesn't show it if there's nothing under it used.   ( ) 21:21, 31 March 2012 (UTC) 
 I would like to make a couple edits to the {{ }}
 At present it does not have assistant coach entries (Note that {{ }} does has assistant coach entries.)
 The first edit I want to make is straightforward:
 I assume I have to edit the info box and use the if statement, because not everyone will list assistant coaches, and not everyone has a director of basketball operations.
 However, I would like to add a field for Associate Head Coach, for those teams with that position. It would be odd to have ""coach"" and ""Associate Head Coach""; I would like to change ""coach"" to ""Head Coach"".
I'm concerned that if I make that change, it will break existing uses of the template.
 How can I do this?--  13:54, 14 April 2012 (UTC)

Narnia has multiple templates which are in their own subcat of c|Narnia. I don't find {{ }} anywhere in his category and I find {{ }} sorted as a 'T' for template article. --  ( ) 19:10, 15 May 2012 (UTC)

 This isn't a template parameter in the sense of this documentation, but I would ordinarily call it the  . 
 The general templates --what term is appropriate?-- {{ }} and {{ }} both commonly begin (or so i have seen in edit mode) 
 .
For what does it matter that the given value match the pagename? 
 Sometimes they differ and I suppose that I have just discovered one problem. The specific templates --term?--  {{ }} and {{ }} are a Navbox with columns and a Navbox that both set  . In both cases, the bluelink 'E' targets {{ }} in edit mode, so one must use 'Edit' in the wikipedia framework to edit the latter.
 I don't know that {{ }} should exist; there is a Characters section in {{ }}. But I should know what breaks if   differs from the pagename. I have noticed other examples recently, when I have visited some templates for other purposes. I have also suggested moving a couple of Templates, an action that must sometimes, may often be the origin of these differences. --  ( ) 17:26, 30 May 2012 (UTC) 
 As the article mention, parameters do not get expanded when they are inside nowiki tags or XML-style extension tags.

 I'm not sure if this is the right place for the following question.  If not, please tell me where to go.  The problem arises at  .  If I list the short template first, they stack horizontally -- a bad outcome:  
 If I reverse the order of  the templates, they stack   vertically, which is good, but the order is misplaced.  One fix is to move down the (long) Econ sidebar a couple of sentences. Vertical  stacking of templates results, which is good, but at the cost of creating an undesirable paragraph break at that point.  Is there any way of getting the short template to list first without breaking the paragraph?  Thank you.  --  ( ) 11:37, 21 November 2012 (UTC)

 I recently changed   to have a consistent spelling of the word ""canonize/canonise"" throughout.  It seemed a little counter-intuitive to use   in an article on a British topic, but since the topic pre-dates standardization of either British or American spelling, I figured it would be okay, and from my understanding both spellings are actually acceptable in British English, just   is more common. Also, the   of the article had been written with the   spelling. I was soon reverted rather sloppily, though.  This revert ignored all the places in the article where   was still in use, and reintroduced inconsistency to the article. I then fixed this with another edit to remove all but one instance of  .  The remaining instance is, unfortunately, part of  , which uses the ""American spelling"" in every article in which it is used. Any idea how to get around this?   ( ) 08:14, 19 February 2013 (UTC)

I have been having an issue with my infobox template. When I make a header for a section in my infobox template (e.g. 
|- 
! colspan=""2"" style=""background-color:#C0C0C0; color:black;"" |Measurements 
|- 
) it works fine, and appears. But if I use the infobox for a character who doesn't have info for a section (e.g. no measurements were provided), the section header appears anyways, even though nothing is under it. I found a page on another wiki that has a template that does the same sort of thing mine does. My template would look kind of like  , if I use it for a character who doesn't have the info supplied. you see, the appearence section should appear, since there is info there. But, there are no stats, but the section header still appears. Is there a way to hide it? So that the template doesn't show it if there's nothing under it used.   ( ) 20:59, 3 March 2013 (UTC)

 Hi. I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question - if there's a better place I'd be grateful if you could direct me there. Thanks. 
 I'm trying to create templates (  and  ) for football league tables where both home and away results are given, as there don't seem to be any such templates already available, and the league tables that give home and away info look less than great as they're presented at the moment (eg.   and  ). I'm nearly there, but there's a couple of problems right at the end that I just can't solve.
 I think the table really needs three slightly heavier vertical lines to visually separate out the home and away results. I've managed to get those in by altering the borders of the HW, AW and GD columns, but for some reason it is automatically also changing these three columns to give them (a) bold font, and (b) a darker background when the background colour isn't specified. So the top of the table looks like the below. I cannot work out why it is doing these two things, or how to stop it. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. Thanks.

 Could someone with more experience with templates than myself please take a look at {{ }}?  The template page was wonky, so I fixed that but then the code produced by the template in articles went wonky.  Looking at the template's code, I have my doubts that this is the most efficient way to make this template work, but I don't usually write templates and this one is a bit over my head. Thank you!     19:13, 6 July 2013 (UTC) 
 Thanks, John!  It looks like this template has needlessly complicated parameters.  I'd like to simplify it, if I knew how, to create a shell text with linked variables that would function essentially like {{ }}, accommodating up to twelve variables.  This would allow template users to list the names of entities with conflicting arms (with piping) in the template. Thus {{SharedArms|Artres|Bettrechies|Cerfontaine|Denain|Eth|Lesquin|Obies|Quérénaing|Semousies|Wambrechies|Warlaing}} would produce:
( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and   use the same arms.)

 I'm   with a parameter that takes a manually-entered string as a value. If the string includes ""{{!}}"", the rendering depends on whether it is in a URL or not.  , the rendering is as ""%7C""; but   in a URL, the rendering is as ""|"". In a test, I found that a URL (a different one) does not necessarily resolve percent-encoding to the unencoded form so the intended address can be reached (tested by percent-encoding either the dot before ""com"" or a letter); the Internet service provider was unable to determine what destination I wanted and sent me some advertising instead. How can I make the parameter display the literal result of the ""{{!}}"" template even if embedded in a URL, just as happens when there's a string without a URL?

 If a parameter value is a URL ending with either an equals sign or a template that generates an equals sign (""="" or ""{{=}}"", respectively, without quotation marks), the displayed result is of a linked URL that extends the link to include the next word in the displayed result, beyond the URL, making following the link difficult except for us geeks perceiving the error.

 I was excited to see that we can now embed Lua code into templates, but the documentation for Wikipedia-specific usage is rather anemic (unless I'm looking in the wrong places). Is there a means of (for example) using Lua to detect the reader's screenname or IP address and generate text accordingly? I always thought that would be useful for certain things.   ( )    
 I'm planning on creating a template that can deal with one- and two-round elections, but don't want the second round columns appearing when the election only has a first round. This is currently done using varieties of Wikitables that combine some cells in the header row, and then combines all the second round cells for candidates that didn't qualify for the second round (if that doesn't make any sense, see  ) so I'm not sure whether it would be possible to create a template that could have such functionality. Basically I want it to be able to do this if there's only one round:
 or this if there's two:
 Ideally the template would have code along the lines of 
 | rounds =
| candidate1 =
| party1 = 
| votesroundone1 = 
| percentroundone1 =
| votesroundtwo1 = 
| percentroundtwo1 = 
 Is this possible, or would two separate templates for one and two-round elections be needed? Cheers,     22:21, 1 December 2013 (UTC) 
 Forgive me, I don't know if I'm using the correct terminology; I'm trying to work with a pre-defined type of table called ""Track Listing"".

en.wikipedia.org,Non-convexity (economics) - Wikipedia,"In  ,   refers to violations of the  . Basic economics textbooks concentrate on consumers with   (that do not prefer extremes to in-between values) and convex   and on producers with convex  ; for convex models, the predicted economic behavior is well understood.   When convexity assumptions are violated, then many of the good properties of competitive markets need not hold: Thus, non-convexity is associated with  ,  where   differ or where   can be  .  Non-convex economies are studied with  , which is a generalization of  . 
 If a preference set is  , then some prices determine a budget-line that supports two   optimal-baskets. For example, we can imagine that, for zoos, a lion costs as much as an eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion. Thus, the zoo-keeper's preferences are non-convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having either animal to having any strictly convex combination of both.
 When the consumer's preference set is non-convex, then (for some prices) the consumer's demand is not  ; A disconnected demand implies some discontinuous behavior by the consumer, as discussed by  :
 If indifference curves for purchases be thought of as possessing a wavy character, convex to the origin in some regions and concave in others, we are forced to the conclusion that it is only the portions convex to the origin that can be regarded as possessing any importance, since the others are essentially unobservable. They can be detected only by the discontinuities that may occur in demand with variation in price-ratios, leading to an abrupt jumping of a point of tangency across a chasm when the straight line is rotated. But, while such discontinuities may reveal the existence of chasms, they can never measure their depth. The concave portions of the indifference curves and their many-dimensional generalizations, if they exist, must forever remain in
unmeasurable obscurity. 
 The difficulties of studying non-convex preferences were emphasized by   and again by  , who wrote that non-convexities are ""shrouded in eternal   according to Diewert. 
 When convexity assumptions are violated, then many of the good properties of competitive markets need not hold: Thus, non-convexity is associated with  , where   differ or where   can be  . 
Non-convex preferences were illuminated from 1959 to 1961 by a sequence of papers in   ( ). The main contributors were   ,  Francis Bator,   ,   and Jerome Rothenberg.  In particular, Rothenberg's paper discussed the approximate convexity of sums of non-convex sets.  These   -papers stimulated a paper by   and  , which considered convexified consumer-preferences and introduced the concept of an ""approximate equilibrium"".  The  -papers and the Shapley–Shubik paper influenced another notion of ""quasi-equilibria"", due to  . 
 Non-convex sets have been incorporated in the theories of general economic equilibria.  These results are described in graduate-level textbooks in  ,  general equilibrium theory,   ,   , 
and applied mathematics (for economists).  The   establishes that non-convexities are compatible with approximate equilibria in markets with many consumers; these results also apply to   with many small  . 
 Non-convexity is important under   and especially  .  Concerns with large producers exploiting market power initiated the literature on non-convex sets, when   wrote about on firms with increasing   in 1926,  after which   wrote about   pricing in 1938.  Both Sraffa and Hotelling illuminated the   of producers without competitors, clearly stimulating a literature on the supply-side of the economy. 
 Recent research in economics has recognized non-convexity in new areas of economics. In these areas, non-convexity is associated with  , where   need not be   or where no competitive equilibrium exists because   differ.  Non-convex sets arise also with   (and other  ),  and with market failures,  and  . 
Non-convexities occur also with  ,  and with   (and other   ).  Such applications continued to motivate economists to study non-convex sets.   In some cases, non-linear pricing or bargaining may overcome the failures of markets with competitive pricing; in other cases, regulation may be justified.
 The previously mentioned applications concern non-convexities in finite-dimensional  , where points represent commodity bundles. However, economists also consider dynamic problems of optimization over time, using the theories of  ,  ,  , and  : Economists use the following optimization methods:
 In these theories, regular problems involve convex functions defined on convex domains, and this convexity allows simplifications of techniques and economic meaningful interpretations of the results.  In economics, dynamic programing was used by Martin Beckmann and Richard F. Muth for work on   and  .  Robert C. Merton used dynamic programming in his 1973 article on the  .  (See also  ). In Merton's model, investors chose between income today and future income or capital gains, and their solution is found via dynamic programming. Stokey, Lucas & Prescott use dynamic programming to solve problems in economic theory, problems involving stochastic processes.  Dynamic programming has been used in optimal  ,  ,  ,  , business  ,  ,   supply, and  . Ljungqvist & Sargent apply dynamic programming to study a variety of theoretical questions in  ,  ,  , economic growth,  , and  .  Dixit & Pindyck used dynamic programming for  .  For dynamic problems, non-convexities also are associated with market failures,  just as they are for fixed-time problems. 
 Economists have increasingly studied non-convex sets with  , which generalizes  . Convex analysis centers on convex sets and convex functions, for which it provides powerful ideas and clear results, but it is not adequate for the analysis of non-convexities, such as increasing returns to scale.  ""Non-convexities in [both] production and consumption ... required mathematical tools that went beyond convexity, and further development had to await the invention of non-smooth calculus"": For example,  's    for   , which uses   and which is described by   and  ,  according to  .   , pp. 1967–1968)  wrote that the ""major methodological innovation in the general equilibrium analysis of firms with pricing rules"" was ""the introduction of the methods of non-smooth analysis, as a [synthesis] of global analysis (differential topology) and [of] convex analysis."" According to  , p. 1966) , ""Non-smooth analysis extends the local approximation of manifolds by tangent planes [and extends] the analogous approximation of convex sets by tangent cones to sets"" that can be non-smooth or non-convex. 
 Exercise 45, page 146:  It will be noted that any point where the indifference curves are convex rather than concave cannot be observed in a competitive market. Such points are shrouded in eternal darkness—unless we make our consumer a monopsonist and let him choose between goods lying on a very convex ""budget curve"" (along which he is affecting the price of what he buys). In this monopsony case, we could still deduce the slope of the man's indifference curve from the slope of the observed constraint at the equilibrium point. A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog

en.wikipedia.org,Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion - Wikipedia,"The   ( ) specify the only cases in which   have broad   to bypass  , at their discretion, and immediately delete Wikipedia pages or media. Because deletion is reversible only by administrators, other deletions occur only after discussion, unless they are  . Speedy deletion is intended to reduce the time spent on deletion discussions for pages or media with   of surviving discussion.  Anyone can request speedy deletion by adding one of the  , but only administrators may actually delete. 
 Before nominating a page for speedy deletion, consider whether it could be improved, reduced to a  , merged or redirected elsewhere, reverted to a better previous revision, or handled in some other way (see  ). A page is eligible for speedy deletion only if all of its   is also eligible. Users nominating a page for speedy deletion should specify which criterion/criteria the page meets, and should notify the page creator and any major contributors. If a page needs to be removed from Wikipedia for privacy reasons (e.g. non-public personal information, a child disclosing their age, possible libel),   instead.
 
For most speedy deletion criteria,  ; only an editor who is not the creator of a page may do so. A creator who disagrees with the speedy deletion should instead click on the   button that appears inside of the speedy deletion tag. This button links to the   with a pre-formatted area for the creator to explain why the page should not be deleted. If an editor other than the creator removes a speedy deletion tag in  , it should be taken as a sign that the deletion is controversial and another deletion process should be used. The creator of a page may remove a speedy deletion tag only if the criterion in question is  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   or  . 
 Administrators should take care not to speedily delete pages or media except in the most obvious cases. If a page has survived its most recent deletion discussion, it should not be speedily deleted except for newly discovered copyright violations and pages that meet specific uncontroversial criteria; these criteria are noted below. Contributors sometimes create pages over several edits, so administrators should avoid deleting a page that appears incomplete too soon after its creation.
 Besides speedy deletion, there are the following methods of deletion:
 
 Letter-number abbreviations (G12, A3...) are often used to refer to these criteria, and are given in each section. For example, ""CSD G12"" refers to   under   (copyright infringement) and ""CSD U1"" refers to   under   (user request). Some in-between numbers are skipped, as abbreviations denoting   remain unused.   to new editors or anyone else unfamiliar with this page; in many situations a   of why a specific page was or should be deleted is preferable.
 
 Immediately following each criterion below is a list of templates used to mark pages or media files for speedy deletion under the criterion being used. In order to alert administrators to the nomination, place the relevant speedy deletion template at the top of the page or media file you are nominating (but see   below). Please be sure to supply an   that mentions that the page is being nominated for speedy deletion. All of the speedy deletion templates are named as   with   standing for 'delete because'. A list of the   templates can be found at  .
 If a page falls under more than one of the criteria, instead of adding multiple tags it is possible to add a single {{ }} tag to cover them all. For example, if an article seems both to be blatantly promotional ( ) and also to fail to indicate significance of its subject (A7) then the tag   can be used to indicate both of these concerns. The article can then be speedily deleted if an administrator assesses it and decides that either or both of the criteria apply.
 There is strong consensus that the creators and major contributors of pages and media files should be warned of a speedy deletion nomination (or of the deletion if not informed before). All speedy deletion templates (using criteria other than U1, G5, G6, G7, and G8) thus contain in their body a pre-formatted, suggested warning template to notify the relevant party or parties of the nomination for speedy deletion under the criterion used. You can copy and paste such warnings to the talk pages of the creators and major contributors, choose from others listed at  , or place the unified warning template,  , which allows you to tailor your warning under any particular criterion by replacing   with the associated criterion abbreviation (e.g. g4, a7).
 Use common sense when applying a speedy deletion request to a page: review the page history to make sure that all earlier revisions of the page meet the speedy deletion criterion, because a single editor can replace an article with material that appears to cause the page to meet one or more of the criteria.
 Some pages either cannot or should not be tagged for speedy deletion in the normal manner:
 As an exception to the norm that a page surviving its most recent deletion discussion means that it should not be speedily deleted, the following criteria apply also to those pages, with or without any specified limitations:
 These criteria may only be used in such cases when no controversy exists; in the event of a dispute, start a new deletion discussion. However, newly discovered copyright violations should be tagged for G12 if the violation existed in all previous revisions of the article. G5 may be also used at discretion, subject to meeting the criterion outlined above.
 
 These apply to   with exclusions listed for specific criteria, and so apply to articles, drafts, redirects, user pages, talk pages, files, etc. Read the specifics for each criterion to see where and how they apply.
 
 This applies to pages consisting entirely of incoherent text or   with no meaningful content or history. It does   cover poor writing, partisan screeds, obscene remarks, implausible theories,  ,  , fictional material, coherent   material, or  . In short, if it is understandable, G1 does not apply. It also does not apply to pages in the  .
 
 This applies to pages created to test editing or other Wikipedia functions. It applies to subpages of the   created as tests, but does   apply to the Sandbox itself, pages in the  , or valid but unused or duplicate templates.
 
 This applies to pages that are blatant and obvious misinformation, blatant   (including files intended to misinform), and redirects created by cleanup from page-move vandalism.   are acceptable if it is clear that they are describing a hoax.
 
 This applies to sufficiently identical copies, having any title, of a page deleted via its most recent  .  It excludes pages that are   substantially identical to the deleted version, and pages to which the reason for the deletion no longer applies.  It excludes pages in userspace and draftspace where the content was converted  to a   for explicit improvement (but not simply to circumvent Wikipedia's  ). This criterion also does not cover content undeleted via a  , or that was only deleted via   (including deletion discussions closed as  ) or speedy deletion.
 
 This applies to pages created by   or   users  , and that have no substantial edits by others.
 
 This is for   maintenance, including:
 
 If requested in good faith and provided that the only substantial content of the page was added by its author. For redirects created as a result of a  , the mover must also have been the only substantive contributor to the pages before the move.  If the sole author   a page other than a userspace page, a category page, or any type of talk page, this can be taken as a deletion request. If an author requests deletion of a page currently undergoing a deletion discussion, the closing admin may interpret that request as agreement with the deletion rationale.
 
 Examples include, but are not limited to:
 This criterion excludes any page that is useful to Wikipedia, and in particular:
 Exceptions may be sign-posted with the template {{ }}.
 
 In exceptional circumstances, the Wikimedia Foundation office reserves the right to speedy-delete a page. Deletions of this type must not be reversed without permission from the Foundation.
 
 Examples of "" "" may include:  ,  , material intended purely to   a person, or   that is entirely negative in tone and unsourced. These pages should be speedily deleted when there is no   version in the page history to revert to. Both the page title and page content may be taken into account in assessing an attack. Articles about living people deleted under this criterion should   be restored or recreated by any editor until the   are met. Other pages violating the Biographies of living persons policy might be eligible for deletion under the conditions stipulated at  , although in most cases a deletion discussion should be initiated instead.
 Redirects from plausible search terms are not eligible under this criterion. For example, a term used on the target page to refer to its subject is often a plausible redirect – see  .
 
 This applies to pages that are   promotional and would need to be   rewritten to serve as encyclopedia articles,  . If a subject is   and the content could plausibly be replaced with text written from a  , this is preferable to deletion.   Any article that describes its subject from a neutral point of view does not qualify for this criterion. However, ""promotion"" does not necessarily mean commercial promotion: anything can be promoted, including a person, a non-commercial organization, a point of view, etc.
 
 This applies to text pages that contain copyrighted material with no credible assertion of public domain, fair use, or a  , where there is no non-infringing content on the page worth saving. Only if the history is unsalvageably corrupted should it be deleted in its entirety; earlier versions without infringement should be retained. For equivocal cases that do not meet speedy deletion criteria (such as where there is a dubious assertion of permission, where free-content edits overlie the infringement, or where there is only partial infringement or close paraphrasing), the article or the appropriate section should be blanked with {{ |url= }}, and the page should be listed at  . Please consult   for other instructions. Public-domain and other free content, such as a  , do not fall under this criterion, nor is mere lack of attribution of such works a reason for speedy deletion. For images and media, see the   in the   here, which has more specific instructions.
 
 This applies to any pages that have not been edited by a human in six months found in:
 Redirects are exempt from G13 deletion.  Adding a CSD template to a page does not reset the six-month clock, but removing a CSD template does.  Pages deleted under G13 may be restored upon request by following the procedure at  .
 
 This applies to the following   pages and redirects:
 If a disambiguation page links to only one article and does not end in  , it should be changed to a redirect, unless it is more appropriate to move the linked page to the title currently used for the disambiguation page.
 
 These criteria apply only to pages in the article (main) namespace. They do not apply to redirects. For any articles that are not speedy deletion candidates, use   or  .
 
 This applies to articles lacking sufficient context to identify the subject of the article.    It applies only to very short articles. Note that   is different from  , treated in  . This   coherent   material, and  . If any information in the title or on the page, including links, allows an editor, possibly with the aid of a web search, to find further information on the subject in an attempt to expand or edit it, A1 is not appropriate. Do not tag under this criterion in the first few minutes after a new article is created. 
 
 This applies to articles not written in English that have essentially the same content as an article on another Wikimedia project. If the article is not the same as an article on another project, use the template   instead, and list the page at   for review and possible translation.
 
 This applies to articles consisting only of external links, category tags or ""See also"" sections, a rephrasing of the title, attempts to correspond with the person or group named by its title, questions that should have been asked at a  , chat-like comments, template tags, or images. This may also apply to articles consisting entirely of the framework of the   with no additional content, or no content at all. However, a very short article may be a valid   if it has context, in which case it is not eligible for deletion under this criterion. Similarly, this criterion does not cover a page having only an infobox, unless its contents also meet another speedy deletion criterion. This criterion   poor writing, coherent   material, and  . Do not tag under this criterion in the first few minutes after a new article is created. 
 
 This applies to any article about a   that does not indicate why its subject is important or significant,  .  This is distinct from   and  , and is a lower standard than  . This criterion applies   to articles about the listed subjects; in particular, it does   apply to articles about albums (these may be covered by  ), products, books, films, TV programs, software, or other creative works, nor to entire   of animals. The criterion   apply if the claim of significance or importance given is not credible, and any article with a blatantly false claim may be   instead. If the claim's credibility is unclear, you can improve the article yourself,  , or list the article at  .
 The criterion does   apply to any article that makes   even if the claim is not supported by a reliable source or does not qualify on Wikipedia's  .
 
 This applies to any article about a   or   where   and that   (  conditions must be met). This is distinct from questions of   and  , and is a lower standard than  . This criterion does   apply to other forms of creative media, products, or any other types of articles.
 The criterion does   apply to any article that makes   even if the claim is not supported by a reliable source or does not qualify on Wikipedia's  .
 
 This applies to any   article with no relevant page history that duplicates an existing English Wikipedia article, and that   within any existing article(s) on the subject, and where the title is  . This does   include   or any article that expands or reorganizes an existing one or that contains referenced,   material. It also does   include disambiguation pages.
 The title chosen for the vast majority of duplicate articles will be a plausible misspelling of, or alternative name for, the existing article, and a   should be created instead of deletion. This criterion should, accordingly, only be used rarely, and only for pages whose titles are not plausible redirects.
 
 This applies to any article that plainly indicates that the subject was  , and does not credibly indicate why its subject is important or significant. The criterion does   apply to any article that makes   even if the claim is not supported by a reliable source or does not qualify under Wikipedia's notability guidelines.  :   (see  ). 
 
 These criteria apply to  , including  , in any namespace, with exclusions listed for specific criteria. For any redirects that are not speedy deletion candidates, use  .
 
 This applies to redirects (apart from  ) from the   to any other namespace   the  ,  ,  ,   and   namespaces.
 
 This applies to   redirects from     or  . However, redirects from common misspellings or misnomers are generally useful, as are some redirects in  . This criterion does   apply to redirects created as a result of a  ,  unless the moved page was also recently created. It also does not apply to articles and stubs that have been converted into redirects, including  ,  or to redirects ending with ""(disambiguation)"" that point to a disambiguation page.
 
 This applies to redirects in the ""File:"" namespace with the same name as a file or redirect at  , provided the redirect on Wikipedia has no   (unless the links are obviously intended for the file or redirect at Wikimedia Commons).
 For redirects that end in ""(disambiguation)"", see  .
 For redirects that are not speedy deletion candidates, use  .
 Redirect pages that have useful page history should never be speedily deleted. In some cases it may be possible to make a useful redirect by changing the target instead of deleting it. Redirects that do not work because of software limitations, such as redirects to special pages or to pages on other wikis, may be converted to soft redirects if they have a non-trivial history or other valid uses.
 For reversal of redirects, use  , a special case of  .
 
 Note: These criteria formerly began with   (e.g. I1, I6, I9) but have since been replaced with  , without the actual criteria being changed. This was because the   was formerly known as the image namespace.
 For any images and other media that are not speedy deletion candidates, use   or  .
 
 This applies to unused duplicates or lower-quality/resolution copies of another Wikipedia file having the same  . This excludes images in the Wikimedia Commons; for these, see criterion  . 
 
 This applies to files that are corrupt, missing, empty, or that contain superfluous and blatant non-metadata information.  This also includes file description pages for Commons files that do not include information that is specific to English Wikipedia (like  ). 
 
 This criterion is used to flag media licensed as "" "" (including non-commercial  ), ""no derivative use"", ""for Wikipedia use only"" or ""used with permission"". These may be deleted, unless they comply with the limited standards for the use of  . Files uploaded after 1 August 2021 licensed under versions of the GFDL earlier than 1.3, without allowing for later versions or other licenses, may be deleted.
 
 This applies to media files lacking the necessary licensing information to verify copyright status after being   as   for  . Administrators should check the upload summary, file information page, and the image itself for a source before deleting under this criterion.
 
 This applies to images and other media that are not under a   or in the   and that are not used in any  . These may be deleted after being   as such for more than   or immediately if the image's   use was on a deleted article and it is   to have any use on any other valid article. This includes previous revisions of the image or files overwritten by copyright violations. Reasonable exceptions may be made for images uploaded for an upcoming article.
 
 This applies to   files claiming fair use but without a  . These may be deleted after being   as such for  . The boilerplate   do not constitute a rationale. This criterion does not apply to situations where a use rationale is provided but is disputed.
 
 
 Provided the following conditions are met:
 
 This applies to obviously non-free images (or other media files) that are not claimed by the uploader to be fair use. A URL or other indication of where the image originated should be mentioned. This does not include images with a credible claim that the owner has released them under a Wikipedia-compatible free license. Most images from stock photo libraries such as Getty Images will not be released under such a license. Blatant infringements should be tagged with the   template. Non-blatant copyright infringements should be discussed at  .
 
 If an   has specified a license and has named a third party as the source/copyright holder without providing evidence that this third party has in fact agreed, the item may be deleted   of the uploader. Acceptable evidence of licensing normally consists of either a link to the source website where the license is stated, or a statement by the copyright holder e-mailed or forwarded to  . Such a confirmation is also required if the source is an organization that the uploader claims to represent, or a web publication that the uploader claims to be their own. Instances of   copyright violations where the uploader would have no reasonable expectation of obtaining permission (e.g. major studio movie posters, television images, album covers, logos that are    , etc.) should be speedily deleted per   (unambiguous copyright infringement), unless fair-use can be claimed. Files tagged with {{ }} for more than 30 days may also be speedily deleted under this criterion. (Please note that the backlog for messages sent to the permissions-en queue is currently 0 days. You may wish to wait at least this amount of time before tagging VRT pending images for deletion.) Files tagged {{ }} whose permissions have not been confirmed after 30 days may be deleted immediately under this criterion, without waiting an additional seven days, provided a check of the ticket is performed by a VRT agent to confirm that no further interaction is ongoing.
 
 For any   pages that are not speedy deletion candidates, use  .
 
 This criterion applies to categories that have been unpopulated for at least seven days. This does not apply to  ,  ,  , categories under discussion at   (or other such  ), or project categories that by their nature may become empty on occasion (e.g.  , or  ). Place {{ }} (or, for administrative categories, {{ }}) at the top of the page to prevent such categories from being deleted.

 These criteria apply only to pages in the User: and User talk: namespaces. For any   that are not speedy deletion candidates, use  .
 
 Personal   and   (but    ) upon request by their user. This also includes   for  . In some rare cases there may be administrative need to retain the page. User talk pages are not eligible for speedy deletion under this criterion. Pages which have previously been moved are only eligible if all previous titles were in the user's userspace.   The template does not display on certain pages (such as   and   pages), but its categorization will work.
 
 This applies to user pages, user subpages, and user talk pages of users that do not exist on the English Wikipedia (check  ), except user pages for IP users who have edited, redirects from misspellings of an established user's user page, and redirects created due to a  . Pages of users who exist on other WMF wikis but do not have local accounts are eligible for deletion. 
 Before placing one of the following templates or deleting a page under this criterion, consider whether moving the page to another location, such as a sub-page of the user page of the primary contributor, is preferable to deletion.
 
 Pages in userspace consisting of  , where the owner has made few or no edits outside of  , except for plausible drafts and pages adhering to  . It applies regardless of the age of the page in question.
 Before placing this template or deleting a page under this criterion:
 
 
This criterion will expire when the number pages eligible to be deleted under it reaches zero.
 Examples: ""Foo(bar)"", ""Joe Smith(disambiguation)"". This does   apply to terms that will correctly or plausibly be searched for without spaces, nor does it apply if the redirect contains substantive page history (e.g. from a merge).   nominating a redirect under this criterion:
 
 The following proposals for new speedy deletion criteria are frequently raised, but have repeatedly failed to gain consensus: 
A7, A9 and A11 do not apply to any other subject that does not indicate importance. Expanding the scope of A7, A9 and A11 to different subjects (such as products, software, books, schools, etc.) have been proposed several times in the past and failed to gain consensus. Amongst the reasons for those rejections were that such subjects are not created often enough to require speedy deletion (such articles can be handled by   or by listing the article at  ), that such subjects cannot be objectively covered in A7, A9 and A11's wording and that admins are not able to assess claims of importance for certain subjects. Before proposing a change to A7, A9 and A11 to expand their scope, please check whether your proposal has not already been discussed on the   ( ).
 The following are not   sufficient to justify speedy deletion:
 
 Make sure to specify the reason for deletion in the deletion summary. Also, in general the article's creator and major contributors should have been notified.
 Before deleting a page, check the   to assess whether it would instead be possible to   and salvage a previous version, or there was actually a   involved. Also:
  for a page:

 In the past, criteria beginning with the following letters were used:

en.wikipedia.org,1971 JVP insurrection - Wikipedia,"Ceylonese government victory
 
 
    Wijesena Vidanage (Sanath)     W.T.Karunnarathe       ( )
 : 37 killed; 195 wounded
 
 
 The   (also known as the  ) was the first of two unsuccessful armed revolts conducted by the     (JVP) against the socialist     (then Ceylon) under    . The revolt began on 5 April 1971 and lasted until June of that year. The insurgents held towns and rural areas for several weeks, until the regions were recaptured by the  , following strong support from friendly nations that sent men and material.  Although this first attempt to seize power was quickly crushed by force, in 1987 the JVP launched a low-intensity insurgency in the island's southern, central and western regions that lasted several years.
 The insurrection formally began in 1971, but the first attacks took place in 1970. The JVP fought the right-wing   (UNP) before launching an island-wide, militant opposition to the newly elected, pro-socialist   government. The government's socialist background drew the attention of many states which needed to support it. The   sent 60 air-force troops;  India guarded the forts, stopping   vessels and a Chinese freighter which raided the harbours. Although China provided diplomatic aid, it was accused of supporting the JVP; Chinese diplomats allegedly contacted North Korea, which supplied weapons and ammunition to the JVP.
 Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) became a   when it gained self-rule from the British on 4 February 1948 with a conservative government formed under the premiership of  , who had been instrumental in the negotiations with the British government which led to self-rule. He founded the   (UNP), amalgamating three right-leaning pro-dominion parties which won a majority in parliament at the general election. The UNP was defeated in 1956, when   became prime minister on a wave of nationalist sentiment bringing together leftist groups. His wife,  , entered politics after his assassination in 1959 and became the world's first female prime minister in 1960. Due to successive governments, varying economic policies and frequent strikes, Ceylon's economic outlook during the 1960s had fallen below what it was when it gained independence in 1948; this led to an  .
 The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) movement was founded during the late 1960s by  , a former   medical student and   functionary. At odds with party leaders and impatient with its lack of revolutionary purpose, Wijeweera formed the movement in 1965 with other like-minded young people. He was apparently expelled from the Maoist wing of the Ceylonese Communist Party the following year and brought his Marxist ideology to what became known as the Sinhalese Marxist Group. Along with Wijeweera, three close supporters emerged as the leaders of the new movement: Sanath, Karunnarathe and   (Loku Athula).  Initially known also as the New Left, the group attracted students and unemployed rural youth (most between ages 16 and 25) who felt that their economic interests had been neglected by the nation's leftist coalitions. The standard program of indoctrination, the ""Five Lectures"", included discussions of Indian imperialism (expansionism), the growing economic crisis, the failure of the island's communist and socialist parties, and the need for a sudden, violent seizure of power.
 The JVP expanded its membership and influence rapidly between 1967 and 1970, gaining control of the student socialist movement on a number of major university campuses (including the  ) and receiving recruits and sympathizers from the armed forces;  some provided sketches of police stations, airports, and military facilities, a factor in the revolt's initial success. At the Vidyalankara campus, it won the support of the Jatika Sishya Sangamaya (Lanka National Students Society) led by G. I. D. ‘Castro’ Dharmasekera, at the Peradeniya campus it gained control of the Samajawadi Sishiya Sangamaya (the Socialist Students Society) and Vidyodaya campus.   lead the Sishiya Sangamaya (Students Society).  To draw new members further into the organization and prepare them for a coming confrontation, Wijeweera opened ""education camps"" in remote areas of the south and south-western coasts, which provided training in   and basic military skills. The movement's   was formed at Madampella in 1969. Following the Madampella conference, two more conferences took place at Urubokka and Dondra. At Urubokka the structure of the organization, with secret, five-member cells and regional commands known as ""district secretaries"" was decided and the prospect of manufacturing weapons was taken up. In the Dondra conference in early 1970, in addition to collecting and manufacturing weapons, details of recruitment, training, uniforms, and collecting information on the armed forces, were discussed.  At this point, it was alleged that Dharmasekera had informed the Minister of State,   about the existence of the JVP and a   (CID) unit under   K. C. de Silva had started investigating this group, which was called the ""  clique"" and began making arrests. Then-opposition leader Sirima Bandaranaike referred to it in her   speech that year. 
 The group had its first public meeting in 1969 and by early 1970, Wijeweera's group began to take a more public role; its cadres campaigned openly for the socialist   (UF) for the  . They also distributed posters and pamphlets promising violent rebellion if Bandaranaike did not address proletarian interests.  In a manifesto issued during this period, the group used the name ""Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna"" (People's Liberation Front) for the first time. Because of the subversive tone of his publications, the   (UNP) government had Wijeweera arrested at Hambantota on 12 May, days before the general elections in May. The UF won a landslide victory against the UNP and formed a government. Wijeweera was released in July 1970. In the politically tolerant atmosphere of the next few months, as the new government attempted to win over a variety of unorthodox leftist groups, the JVP intensified its public campaign and secret preparations for a revolt. Although their group was relatively small, the members hoped to immobilize the government by selective kidnapping and sudden, simultaneous strikes against security forces throughout the island. Some of the necessary weapons had been bought with funds supplied by members, but most party funding came from a string of robberies. The JVP decided to rely on raids against police stations and army camps to secure weapons at the onset of the revolt, and they planned to manufacture their own explosive weapons in preparation. 
 By 1970, the movement had begun recruiting and training cadres at camps in rural areas of  ,  ,  ,   and  . Classes delivering the ""Five Lectures"" were held throughout the island, primarily in secluded locations such as cemeteries. After raising a force of about 10,000 full-time members, the JVP stopped recruiting in 1971. The movement was based on five-member cells with a leader, and there were several such cells in a police station area with an area leader. The area leaders selected a district leader, and the district leaders made up the Central Committee. Above the Central Committee was a 12-member   which included Wijeweera. Communications were in code by couriers, with the district secretaries communicating messages from the Politburo (which met every two months in  ).  The JVP published a newspaper (the  , or  ), and carried out several robberies – including the Okkampitiya and Ambalangoda bank robberies, the Badulla mailbag robbery and the York Street robbery – to raise money. Members were also asked to contribute personal funds. 
 In September 1970, the JVP Political Bureau met at Ambalangoda and decided to begin collecting arms, with Loku Athula appointed to head the armed section. The group identified that the primary weapon in their arsenal would be the hand bomb and planned to make over 100,000 in several bomb-making factories located in rural areas along with underground storage locations. At the next Political Bureau, at the end of the year, Loku Athula reported that 3,000 bombs had been manufactured. The JVP gave   30,000 stolen from York Street to   (alias Podi Athula) to manufacture bombs.  The bombs were crude home-made types that sometimes exploded in the process of manufacture. One such incident took place on 17 December 1970, Podi Athula lost his left hand and was critically injured when a grenade exploded while being tested. The cells began arming themselves with  ; each member was expected to have a shotgun, 10 cartridges, blue uniforms, military boots, and  . However, this process had mixed results, the JVP was only able to manufacture around 3,000 bombs and some exploded in the process. A JVP cache of weapons was found by the police at the Talagalle Temple at Homagama and at the Vidyodaya Campus, the JVP produced blue uniforms, cartridge belts, boots and helmets. 
 Since its formation in 1949,   were an internal security force assisting the   during strikes and riots. After the  , the armed forces had major cuts in funding, recruitment and joint operations, and were unprepared for a large-scale insurrection.  In 1970, the armed forces had an annual budget of Rs 52 million (US$10mn), just 1.2% of total government expenditure. The   had an authorized strength of 329 officers and 6,291 other ranks with three infantry regiments each consisting of two   (one regular and one volunteer) armed mostly with World War II-era weapons such as   rifles,  ,   and  , with a few  ; a recce regiment equipped with   and  ; an artillery regiment armed with light   and  .  It lacked tanks, field artillery, automatic rifles, submachine guns and other modern weapons, and peacetime ammunition stocks could sustain only one week of combat operations. The  , which had suffered the most from the fallout of the attempted coup (its recruitment had been frozen until 1969) had only one  ,   in its fleet along with a few Thorneycroft  . The   which had three flying squadrons and a few trained pilots in 1971,   consisted of nine   tasked with basic pilot training; the   had three  , four   and three   fixed-wing aircraft and three   helicopters; and the   had two de Havilland Doves tasked with maritime patrol. It had mothballed its five   jet trainers after plans for introducing jet fighters were scrapped. 
 The government received multiple warnings of preparations undertaken by the JVP, but failed to comprehend the scale of the insurrection and was unprepared to counter it. Early warnings came from the   (CID), which had been tasked with   with its late-1969 and early-1970 establishment of the ""Che Guevara Desk"" under ASP K. C. de Silva.  , former   who had been appointed special security advisor to the  , submitted a report on the new group's potential threat to Prime Minister  's government. The government instructed the police to arrest Wijeweera, who was taken into custody in May 1970. After the  , however, newly elected Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike had Wijeweera released from police custody; reports from the previous administration were overlooked. Bandaranaike's new administration made changes to the police force, removing officers and disbanding units perceived as disloyal. These changes affected the CID; the new government was fearful of another coup by security forces loyal to the previous administration. Bandaranaike's cousin and  , a captain in the   was promoted to   and appointed commanding officer of the Army's Field Security Detachment, tasked with   by identifying potentially-disloyal officers. Captain   (who led the investigations) reported that a more substantial threat to the government was posed by the JVP, and the police investigation of bomb-making factories began. 
 In 1970, a parcel sent by the   containing Chinese-made rifles was captured by the police; other similar incidents occurred at the beginning of the insurgency. The   had sent a delegation early in 1965, meeting Wijeweera. 
 Wijeweera also visited North Koreans in the country, who congratulated him.  He sent a JVP member to the Middle East to forge a link with the  . The envoy returned with a letter from the government promising to ship weapons to the island if possible,  hinting at aid from South Yemen diplomats to the JVP.
 After a lull since October 1970, the JVP held a large public rally on 27 February 1971 at Colombo's Hyde Park, where Wijeweera said: ""Let the revolution of the workers, farmers, and soldiers be triumphant"". It would be the last JVP rally before the insurrection.
 At this point, there seems to be a division within the JVP. A faction led by Castro Dharmasekera wanted the movement to remain secret and prepare for a guerrilla war. However, the majority of the carder disagreed and Dharmasekera and his supporters were expelled. On 6 March, this faction calling themselves the Maoist Youth Front began   in front of the United States Embassy in Colombo. These turned violent on 10 March with a petrol bomb thrown at the embassy, rioters then attacked and damaged the vehicles parked outside the embassy. Led by  , members of the   attacked the embassy. 
A police officer on duty outside the embassy was stabbed and later died. The student elements of the   (CCP) and the JVP were suspected of being the embassy attack and the government ordered a crackdown on these groups.
 On 9 March, after an accidental explosion in one of the JVP bomb factories which killed five members, police found 58 bombs in a hut in Nelundeniya,  . This gained national attention and indicated that JVP was arming itself. A few days later on 16 March, an explosion took place at Marrs Hall at the Peradeniya campus. The police search the halls of residence at the Peradeniya campus and found a stock of detonators at Hilda Obeysekera Hall. 
 Although the JVP denounced Dharmasekera, Wijeweera and hundreds of his supporters were arrested during March, the JVP claimed that 4,000 cadres were now behind bars. Wijeweera traveled around the country but was arrested on 13 March in   by a special police team and later transferred to the Jaffna Prison, along with 450 others. As a result of the attack on the US Embassy and explosions, the government declared a   on 16 March, giving broader powers to the police and military for arrest and detention, but no general military mobilization took place. The Ceylon Army, deployed two platoons of the 1st Battalion, Ceylon Light Infantry (1CLI) to the  , followed by two platoons to Kandy. By 27 March, the police and the army had arrested over 300 youths mainly from the CCP in connection with the embassy attack and had raided the Vidyodaya and Vidyalankara campuses. By April 2, more than 400 arrests had been made. 
 With the arrest of Wijeweera and other mass arrests of its carders, a meeting was held at the     (temple) by the JVP politburo on 2 April in response to a request by Wijeweera that posters and leaflets calling for his release be published and, if the insurgency began, 500 cadres be sent to Jaffna to break him out of prison. The group, consisting of S. V. A. Piyathilaka, Lionel Bopage,  , Sunanda Deshpriya,  , W. T. Karunarathne, Susi L. Wickrama, Wijesena Vidanage (alias Sanath), Somasiri Kumanayake and Anura Ranjith Kurukulasooriya, decided that all   in the country would be attacked on 5 April at 11:00 pm. The JVP believed that police stations were the government's principal local element of power, and hoped that disabling them would encourage local populations to rise up in their support. The district leader for   and   was not at the meeting, and the decision to attack was conveyed via a paid radio obituary notice by   that read: ""JVP Appuhamy expired. Funeral 5."". The Wellawaya leader interpreted the order as to attack on the morning of 5 April, not in the evening. 
 Four missions were planned and assigned to the nationwide 5 April attack. The main responsibility for the attacks was given to the student wing, which Wijeweera had called the ""Red Guard"". The first of the four missions was to attack the  , which was one of the country's largest military installations and housed a large  . Piyasiri was in charge of the attack by 800 students, who were divided into groups of twenty-five; a smaller attack was to be made on  . The second mission, led by Nimal,  , Sanath Kumar, and Lal Pieries with more than 50 students, was to abduct the prime minister. The third mission, led by Bopage, was to capture of the city of Colombo. The capital was divided into five areas: Colombo South, Colombo North, Kandy Road, Colombo Central, and Kotte. The insurgents were to attack police stations along the way, obtaining arms and ammunition from them. The targets were  ,  ,   and the homes of government officials, including Justice Minister  , the   and the  . The fourth mission was to rescue Wijeweera from prison in Jaffna. 
 Planning for the countrywide insurrection was hasty and poorly coordinated, with some district leaders not informed until the morning of the uprising. At 5:20 am on 5 April, the   police station was attacked and two police constables were killed.  The Wellawaya attack had preempted the initial wave of simultaneous attacks planned by the JVP, which lost the element of surprise. Following the attack, soon after dawn on 5 April,    ,   ordered a platoon of the 1st Battalion,   from   to Wellawaya. At 7:00 am,   reported the attack and warned of further attacks. Major  , Army HQ   (Ops), and DIG   flew by an air force helicopter to Wellawaya that morning to inspect the ground situation in Wellawaya and reported to Attygalle and the   (IGP). The government began frantic preparations for further attacks. A curfew was declared in parts of the island, all police stations were warned of an impending attack, and Attygalle ordered the army to begin  . 
 Several JVP cadres were arrested at   on 5 April as they prepared to abduct (or assassinate) Prime Minister Bandaranaike at her private residence at Rosemead Place. This was followed by a quick citywide curfew and more arrests in Kotahena and Borella, with large numbers of bombs, weapons, and medical equipment meant to be used in the planned attack on the city. At 8:00 pm, General Attygalle, IGP   and Lieutenant Colonel Anuruddha Ratwatte arrived at the prime minister's residence and briefed her on the attack on Wellawaya and an impending attack that night. Soon afterwards, the prime minister left for   (her official residence) with General Attygalle, Captain A.R.P. (Kalu) Wijeratne, and her normal escort. Temple Trees became the centre of government operations (both civil and military) during the crisis, and its security was strengthened. It was a refuge for the ministers, most of whom were from leftist parties. Helicopter patrols around the capital began as rumours spread that the JVP was marching on Colombo. 
 With a curfew imposed and suspects being arrested, some JVP leaders went into hiding. The attack began as planned. Ninety-two police stations across the country were attacked simultaneously by JVP groups armed with shotguns, bombs, and Molotov cocktails; five (in  ,  ,  ,   and  ) were overrun by the insurgents, and 43 were abandoned by the police for ""strategic reasons"" during the following days. Fifty-seven police stations were damaged. The insurgents cut telephone and power lines and blocked roads with trees. The Hanwella police station, near Colombo, was attacked on 6 April and overrun. It was soon recaptured by army reinforcements from the Panagoda Cantonment. The No. 2 Squadron of the Royal Ceylon Air Force deployed its three   helicopters, which began flying missions to remote police stations to supply them with weapons and ammunition; over the following days, the helicopters returned wounded to hospitals.   was also attacked. The police withdrew personnel from smaller police stations. The rebels had taken control of   and the town of   in the   by 10 April, and came close to capturing the remainder of   except for cities of   and   (both of which had two Dutch colonial forts and small army garrisons). However, none of the JVP's four major missions succeeded. The abduction of the prime minister failed, with arrests of JVP members in Colombo on 5 April. The Panagoda Cantonment and Colombo were never attacked, because the members did not assemble. Jaffna Prison was attacked on the night of 5 April to rescue Wijeweera. The cadre booked a bus to the prison, and Pyatilake led the attack. It failed, however, when police reinforcements arrived; many of the attackers were arrested, and some were killed. Attacks on the Jaffna police station and Karainagar naval detachment also failed, with four insurgents killed on 6 April at  . 
 Loku Athula, who was given leadership of the Kegalle District and Kurunegala District, moved into the area on 3 April and began organizing the area leaders. He coordinated operations with detachments in Veyangoda and Mirigama, with over 600 JVP carders deployed across the Kegalle District concentrated at Warakapola and Rambukkana. The Pindeniya detachment, led by Patrick Fernando attacked both the local Police Station and the Bogala Graphite Mines, capturing a lorry load of explosives from the mines. On 8 April, the Warakapola Police Station was attacked, weapons including two submachine guns seized and the building set alight. Police stations in Bulathkohupitiya, Aranayaka, Mawanella, Rambukkana and Dedigama were attacked and the one at Aranayake burned down. Only the police station in Kegalle town and its surrounding area remained under government control in the Kegalle District. In the North Central Province, only the Anuradhapura town and its police station held out, while the police station in Vavuniya and Polonnaruwa were attacked. Less intense activity was reported in the Kandy, Badulla and Moneragala Districts. 
 Having lost the element of surprise and coordination, the JVP's first wave of attacks was executed as planned. Although on high alert, the government could do little to prepare and withstand the first wave. Weapons and ammunition were a key problem for both sides, with the JVP lacking access and aimed at gaining these from the police and military they would overrun in their first wave; while the government soon found out that its pre-insurrection stocks of small-arms ammunition was enough to hold out for only a week. On 5 April when the warning of the impending attack was issued, some police stations found that they lacked operational firearms or live ammunition. The three Bell 206A Jet Ranger helicopters of the RCyAF began on 5 April with a furry of activity, they began flying weapons and ammunition to isolated police stations. Flying over 12 hours a day, these three helicopters airlifted 36,500 lb of ammunition during April. The Doves flew supply missions to different parts of the island moving 900 soldiers and 100,000 lb of equipment in April. The army reported its first   on the first day of the insurrection when Staff Sergeant Jothipala was killed at Thulhiriya in the Kurunegala District. 
 As the insurgents overran five police stations and forty-three were abandoned in the days that followed, the JVP gained control over large parts of the island uncontested. They would raise the red flag and assert their dominance over the population. The government forces responded by first securing Colombo, other cities and large towns with sizable police and military garrisons. Roadblocks were set up; bridges, ports and airports were secured, overstretching the armed forces, which began mobilizing its  . Army, navy, and air-force personnel were initially deployed on ground duty in a defensive posture; in most areas, the police were able to hold out themselves. The government considered the situation dire during the insurrection's early days; its pre-insurrection stocks of small-arms ammunition were expected to run out in a week, and the shooting of   by a fellow rating in Jaffna stoked fears of JVP infiltration of the armed forces. Therefore, the government adopted a strategy of holding out, until it received assistance from friendly nations. 
 Former   (IGP)   was appointed Additional Permanent Secretary to the  , and coordinated the government's defense from the situation room at Temple Trees. Local military coordinating officers, appointed from the three branches of the armed forces for each affected district, were tasked with carrying out local   operations. These were Colonel   in Anuradhapura, Colonel   in Badulla, Colonel   in Galle, Colonel   in Hambantota, Lieutenant Colonel R. R. Rodrigo in Jaffna, Lieutenant Colonel   in Kegalle, Lieutenant Colonel D. J. de S. Wickremasinghe in Matara, Lieutenant Colonel   in Moneragala and Lieutenant Colonel   in Vavuniya. These appointments changed rapidly as the ground situation changed. 
 With many parts of the island under JVP control, communication and transport was limited. The JVP had blocked roads having fallen trees, damaged culverts and bridges preventing vehicular movements. Many army convoys were ambushed such as in Aranayake and in Anuradhapura, where Captain   was killed. Initial government offensives were pushed back in areas such as  , where local     was wounded accompanying the first joint army and police expedition into rebel-held areas. 
 With the government desperately short of weapons and ammunition, Bandaranaike   a request for support to friendly countries. The response from many governments was swift. The   was the first to respond positively, allowing the Ceylonese government to use an     to ferry small arms and ammunition from its bases in   within four days of the initial attack. This was followed by a British commitment to supply six   helicopters armed with 7.62mm machine guns.
 The United States said that it was aware that the JVP was not the organization which  , but had no specific intention to militarily aid the government. On a request made by the previous government, a     landed on 12 April carrying much-needed spares for RCyAF helicopters.
 Pakistan responded with an airlift of supplies, troops, and helicopters to  , taking over the airport's defense and freeing Ceylonese troops for other duties.
 India did not receive the cable, and the Indian High Commissioner in Ceylon was sent back to India with the aid request on 13 April. The day after units of the   were airlifted from   and   (Chennai) to  , and six   from the   followed with arms and ammunition. The squadron logged 573 flying hours on as many as 1,122   in Ceylon. 150   took over securing RCyAF Katunayake.   heavy transports flew in six   helicopters and ammunition purchased from Singapore on 17 April.
 Ceylon received the most aid from the Soviet Union, with Air Ceylon transporting nine tons of military equipment which the Soviet Union made available from supplies in Cairo on the 19th of April. On 22 April,     transporters flew in with five  F fighter bombers, a   trainer, and two   helicopters. The Soviet aircraft were accompanied by 200 trainers and ground crew. In addition, the Soviet Union also sent 12 light mortars and 10   armoured personnel carriers in November.    supplied four  . Although China supplied 30  , 30,000 automatic and semi-automatic rifles, it was still suspected of supporting the JVP. 
 The   deployed three frigates, the  , the   and the   setting up a naval cordon around Ceylon while the Royal Ceylon Navy had deployed its sailors (including the crew of its sole frigate) on shore duty and harbour defense, making it incapable of preventing the JVP from obtaining aid by sea. Soon harbor defense was taken over by Indian and Pakistani troops, releasing Ceylonese personnel for offensive operations.   donated 5,000 SLR rifles. 
 North Korea used revolutionary propaganda daily in newspapers; North Korean newspapers quoted   about the revolution, and the government of Sri Lanka was suspicious of the country's motives. JVP bases contained   literature distributed by the North Korean high commission in the country, which helped to develop the party. On 15 May 1971, 18 North Koreans affiliated with the JVP were arrested. Indian patrol boats deployed around the island stopped two North Korean vessels, capturing weapons, food parcels and literature; the vessels may have been headed to JVP-controlled territory to reinforce it against the Ceylonese army.  Aid may also have come through the Ceylon-North Korea Friendship Association, which had branches throughout the country. 
 At the time of the start of the insurrection, there was a Chinese cargo vessel bound for Tanzania in the Colombo Harbour. The Ceylonese government requested to acquire these arms failed following appeals to both Beijing and Dar es Salaam. Thereafter, the Ceylonese government said that the weapons were for the JVP.  In April, a Chinese freighter raided a harbour; it was turned back by Indian warships maintaining a naval cordon around Ceylon's coast.  An unfamiliar ship was seen off the JVP-controlled coast of Matara; according to an eyewitness, it was larger than any ship the Royal Ceylon Navy had at the time. 
 Having lost the element of surprise, the JVP's initial attack did achieve a degree of success. However, it failed in its key missions. This meant that it was not able to acquire the modern weapons it need to face the government forces. By withdrawing its small police stations and army detachments, the government denied the JVP the opportunity to capture weapons and ammunition. Having withdrawn to defensible locations such as major cities and towns, the government brought time to replenish its limited stocks of ammunition and receive new weapons.
 Wijeweera had been successful in building up the political ideology and the large following of carders. However, these carders large in numbers, lacked proper military training. In comparison, the government forces especially its regulars, although small in number were an all-volunteer professional army with better leadership and training. When the influx of modern weaponry and ammunition began to roll in, the tide turned. The wide array of weapons it received resulted in its own logistical problems.
 The regular personnel of the armed services were soon supplemented by the mobilization of reservists (most of whom were World War II veterans) and while Pakistani and Indian troops that were flown in took over the defense of key installations such as airports and harbors. This released the regular troops from static defense to offensive operations. Furthermore, the popular uprising Wijeweera expected from the oppressed classes failed to take place and JVP carders who captured areas did not consolidate these nor prepare for a long drawn out insurgency, as the JVP had not planned for such; local JVP committees raised a red flag in a captured area, and did little else. Widespread looting and damage to state property took place, and several civilians were murdered by the insurgents. 
 The RCyAF took out five   which had been mothballed in 1970, serviced and armed them in three days, and flew them from   to RCyAF Katunayake (attacking rebel locations en route). On the 12 April following a bombing run on a target in Polonnaruwa, one Jet Provost lost power and crashed on its approach to RCyAF Chinabay killing its pilot,   Ranjith Wijetunga.  Several weeks later, the Jet Provosts were joined by the Bell 47-G2s in ground attacks.
 The government forces began to enhance its firepower on the ground and began offensive operations into JVP-controlled areas. The Yugoslavian mountain guns were deployed in Kegalle to flush out insurgents and by late April many suspected JVP members were captured, arrested or surrendered. The remaining carders withdrew into the jungle in the Kegalle, Elpitiya, Deniyaya and Kataragama areas. The army received twelve British   armoured cars in May and put them to use in Kurunegala and Anuradhapura districts. After three weeks of fighting, the government regained control of all but a few remote areas. In most cases, the government regained control of townships; insurgent groups melted away into the jungle and continued to operate, with some groups operating into early 1972. The government announced two amnesties in May and June 1971, airdropping leaflets encouraging the insurgents to surrender. Without food, weapons, and leadership, many youths surrendered; other groups were surrounded and captured. Two JVP leaders, Sanath (Wijesena Vidanage) and Susil, were killed in confrontations with the armed forces;  , who led the remnants of his group from Kegalle into the jungles of  , was wounded and captured. In jungles in Anuradhapura, the JVP had established a base camp with supplies along with six sub-camps with which they conducted operations in Rajangana and Tambuttegama. A detachment from the 1CLI troops with 82mm mortars, commanded by Major Jayawardena carried out Operation Otthappuwa in May and cleared these camps. By the end of May, much of the insurrection was crushed. Counter-insurgency operations went on for another year, with the 1CLI establishing a forward base in Horowapatana from November 1972 to April 1973, while the D company, 1CLI closed its operations in Kegalle District only in December 1974. Many youths were detained in rehabilitation camps for months. The official arrest total was 5,067 (of whom 1,117 were from Colombo), but arrests of up to 20,000 were claimed. The government imposed strict censorship of all domestic and foreign news during the period. Reports of summary executions were reported, including the public execution of   of Kataragama. Caste-based discrimination was common with armed forces arresting all the youth from low-caste villages, regardless of participation. 
 The official death toll was 1,200, but unofficial sources reliably estimated it at 4,000–5,000. Forty-one civilians were killed by the insurgents; thirty-seven police officers were killed and 195 were wounded. Twenty-six armed-services personnel were killed, including one officer (19 from the Army, four from the air force, and three from the Navy) and 130 were wounded (87 Army, 15 air force, and 28 Navy) in 1971 and 1972. 
 Advised by Justice Minister Felix Dias Bandaranaike, the prime minister appointed an investigative unit headed by retired IGP   to prosecute the captured insurgents. The unit was made up of   and police officers. The crown counsels were made  , enabling them to record statements from suspects which would be admissible in court. It soon became apparent that convicting a large number of suspects in custody within the contemporary procedure and laws would take years. 
 The Criminal Justice Commission was established by the government to prosecute the detained rebels expediently. The commission was composed of Chief Justice H. N. G. Fernando (chairman), Justice  , Justice V. T. Thamotheram, Justice H. Dheragoda and Justice  . By 1975, 139 inquiries were conducted and 3872 insurgent suspects were charged and 2919 were produced before the commission. 2413 suspects were released under suspended sentences while 258 received terms of rigorous imprisonment, which included 3 imprisonments for life. 50 suspects were acquitted. A second commission was formed in 1976, consisting of three judges. 2520 suspects were released under a suspended sentence, while 372 received terms of rigorous imprisonment, which included 5 imprisonments for life. 92 suspects were acquitted.  In 1975, Wijeweera was sentenced to life imprisonment (later reduced to 20 years of  ). Many of the surviving JVP leaders received prison sentences; some, including   and Somasiri Kumanayake, turned crown witness and were pardoned. Most of the youths in rehabilitation camps were released gradually. 
 The insurgency caused Rs 2.7 million in damage to public and private property; other institutions lost Rs 3 million. Over Rs 450 million earmarked for capital development was not spent as intended due to the insurgency. Ceylon severed diplomatic ties with North Korea based on information that the country supported the JVP and diplomatic relations were not reestablished till 2014.  The government expanded the armed forces, the air force which had 1,400 personnel in 1971 grew to 3,100 by 1976 with the addition of a   and the army formed the  . The police formed the   in 1974. Under the six years of emergency rule following the uprising, the JVP remained dormant. No medals were awarded by the government to the police or armed services personnel. After the victory of the United National Party in the  , however, the new government tried to broaden its mandate with a period of political tolerance. With the repeal of the Criminal Justice Commission in 1977, all convicted under it received a general amnesty including Wijeweera. The ban on the party was lifted, and the JVP entered the arena of legal political competition. As a candidate in the  , Wijeweera finished fourth with over 250,000 votes (compared with winner  's 3.2 million).
 The JVP began a  , which lasted from 1987 to 1989 and was more of a   than an open revolution. The movement fought with a well-organized military wing, that carried out raids on military installations and targeted assassinations waging a brutal campaign of terror and intimidation across the Southern part of the island. It ended after an equally brutal counter-offensive targeting JVP cells and leadership that resulted in the death of Wijeweera in 1989.
 Two incentives for a renewed insurgency exist unemployment and government corruption. With a rapid population increase and relatively-slow economic growth, many youths who were the beneficiaries of free education are unemployed or underemployed; the unemployment rate is high relative to the output of the educational system, which the labour market has failed to address.

 A few days after Yesh Atid's registration, in a surprise move,   formed a national unity government. It was then thought that Lapid's party would have to wait until late 2013 before it could participate in national elections. But in October 2012, following the departure of Kadima from Netanyahu's coalition over how to implement a Supreme Court decision ending the exemption from the military draft for the ultra-Orthodox, Netanyahu announced that elections would take place in late January 2013, affording Yesh Atid its first opportunity to run.

 After the election, Yesh Atid joined the new government led by Netanyahu. Lapid was named   on 15 March 2013.  Only nine months later, a survey was published showing a continuing trend of decreasing popularity, with 75% of those polled claiming to be disappointed by his performance, and his party achieved only 10 seats in the Knesset, as opposed to the 19 it got at the beginning of the year. 
 On 2 December 2014, Netanyahu fired Lapid as finance minister.  At the same time, Netanyahu also dismissed   party leader   from her cabinet post. 
 Yesh Atid won eleven seats in the  , a decrease of eight seats.  In the resulting Knesset, Yesh Atid sat in the opposition to a government headed by Netanyahu. 
 In 2016, Lapid presented his platform, the ""Seven Point Plan for Israel"", which included a robust security doctrine, a regional conference with Arab states based on the necessity of separating from the Palestinians, reforms of the political system to clean up corruption, the State of Israel that strikes a balance between its Jewish and democratic character, a strengthened law enforcement system, an economy propelled forward by innovation, and increased emphasis on education and science.  Lapid and Yesh Atid claimed to spearhead the fight against corruption in Israel. The ""Nachshon Plan"", unveiled in 2017, stipulates that any person found guilty of corruption will be banned from serving in public office.

Yesh Atid continued to sit as an opposition party.  Lapid served as  
 On 5 May 2021, Lapid was entrusted with the second mandate to form a new government, after the incumbent Netanyahu failed to do so with the first mandate.  On 9 May 2021, it was reported that Lapid and Bennett had made major headway in the coalition talks.  However, on 10 May, coalition talks seemed to be jeopardized as the   announced it was suspending coalition talks, due to escalation in the  .  On 13 May his path to being Prime Minister was further complicated when   reportedly decided against joining a Lapid government due to the ongoing military conflict with Gaza. 
 On 30 May 2021, Bennett announced in a televised address that Yamina would indeed join a unity government with Lapid, after all but one of Yamina's MKs agreed to back this decision.  On 2 June 2021, following negotiations with Lapid and Bennett, Ra'am leader   officially signed a coalition agreement with Lapid and agreed to allow his party to join.  The Knesset ultimately voted in favor of the new government by a one-vote margin on 13 June.  the government was sworn in that same day, with Lapid becoming the   and the  . 
 Upon becoming the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lapid's ministry assumed the duties of the now-defunct  .  Several weeks later Lapid inaugurated Israel's embassy in  , in what was the first official visit of the country by a member of the Israeli Government.  In August 2021, he appointed former     as  , and former Member of the Knesset   as ambassador to  . 
 On 11 August, Lapid visited   to inaugurate Israel's embassy in the city.  In September, he inaugurated the Israeli Embassy in  ,  and announced the re-establishment of  . 
 Lapid became the interim   on 1 July 2022,  after the Knesset had voted to dissolve and call a snap election the previous day.  The rotation government agreement had specified that if a snap election were called while Bennett was still prime minister, then Lapid would rotate into the premiership as acting prime minister until the next government would be formed after the election. During his premiership, Lapid continued to hold the additional office of minister of foreign affairs. 
 During his term, Israel was involved in a   with the   in the Gaza Strip dubbed ""Operation Breaking Dawn"".  The three-day August operation was widely regarded as successful. The operation was overseen primarily by Lapid and Gantz (who was serving as  ).  The operation was limited in its scope. 
 In the  , Yesh Atid won 24 seats.  A new government was formed by  , who succeeded Lapid as Prime Minister on 29 December 2022.  Lapid became the Leader of the Opposition for a second time on 2 January 2023. 
 Lapid participated in the  . 
 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposed that opposition parties Yesh Atid and National Unity enter an emergency unity government amid the  ,  after Leader of the Opposition Lapid urged Nethanyahu put ""aside our differences and form an emergency, narrow, professional government.""  Only Gantz's National Unity accepted the offer. Lapid took issue with the structure Netanyahu offered, as well as the fact that Netanyahu would not remove   and   as ministers in his government. Lapid regarded both of these men to be extremists. 
 On 28 March 2024, Lapid won   with 52.5% of the vote,  narrowly beating   by 308 votes to 279. 
 Lapid has said that he would demand a resumption of negotiations between Israel and the  .  His party's 2013 platform calls for an outline of "" "", while maintaining the large   blocs, a united Jerusalem, and ensuring Israel's safety.  In January 2013, just days before the election, Lapid said he would not join a cabinet that stalled peace talks with the  , and added that a single country for both Israelis and Palestinians without a peace agreement would endanger Israel's Jewish character. He said, ""We're not looking for a happy marriage with the Palestinians, but for a divorce agreement we can live with.""  As part of a future peace agreement, Lapid said Palestinians would have to recognize that the large West Bank settlement blocs of  ,   and   would remain within the State of Israel.  According to Lapid, only granting Palestinians their own state could end the conflict and Jews and Arabs should live apart in two states, while Jerusalem should remain undivided under Israeli rule.  He is enthusiastic about annexing the  , and has also declared that he is guided by a principle of ""maximum Jews on maximum land with maximum security and with minimum Palestinians."" 
 Of the diplomatic stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, Lapid said, ""Most of the blame belongs to the Palestinian side, and I am not sure that they as a people are ready to make peace with us.""  He has also dismissed the possibility of a comprehensive peace deal with the Palestinians as unrealistic. 
 In June 2015, after the March 2015 elections, Lapid visited the United States, and after an hour-long interview, American journalist Jeffrey Goldberg wrote, ""Lapid is a leader of the great mass of disillusioned centrists in Israeli politics. He could conceivably be prime minister one day, assuming Benjamin Netanyahu, in whose previous cabinet he served, ever stops being prime minister. Now functioning as a kind of shadow foreign minister, Lapid argues that Israel must seize the diplomatic initiative with the Palestinians if it is to continue existing as a Jewish-majority democracy, and he is proposing a regional summit somewhat along the lines of the earlier Arab Peace Initiative. Lapid is not a left-winger—he has a particular sort of contempt for the Israeli left, born of the belief that leftists do not recognize the nature of the region in which they live. But he is also for territorial compromise as a political and moral necessity, and he sees Netanyahu leading Israel inexorably toward the abyss."" 
 In September 2015, Lapid laid out his diplomatic vision in a major speech at Bar Ilan University  in which he said, ""Israel's strategic goal needs to be a regional agreement that will lead to full and normal relations with the Arab world and the creation of a demilitarized independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. That's where Israel needs to head. Separation from the Palestinians with strict security measures will save the Jewish character of the state.""
 Lapid supports recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the  . He stated in 2017 that with   attempting to establish a foothold in Syria, Israel cannot be expected to relinquish the Golan Heights. 
 In 2013, when Yesh Atid sat in the government, Lapid pushed for increased public transportation on  , as opposed to the current law that mandates most public transportation shut down. 
 Additionally, Lapid strongly supports instituting a  . Currently,   for Jews are controlled by the Chief Rabbinate, which will not officiate marriages between Jews and non-Jews, and some Israelis from the Soviet Union who are not Jewish according to Jewish law cannot marry in Israel.  Although Israel recognizes civil marriages that are performed abroad, there is no mechanism for performing civil marriage in Israel. In 2015, under Lapid's leadership, Yesh Atid championed a bill to institute civil marriage, but the bill was defeated in the Knesset, with 50 votes against and 39 in favor. 
 When Netanyahu walked back his promise to Diaspora Jews in 2017 to expand prayer at the  , Lapid strongly criticised the decision, saying that the Israeli government alienated ""senators, congressmen, the majority of the pro-Israel lobby, major donors, the people we turn to when we need help ensuring that Israel will get advanced weapons, that the military assistance will increase, that there will be sanctions on Iran"".  He implored   to ""not give up on us. We have no intention of giving up on you. We are one people. It might take time. It might take elections. But in a democracy, the majority decides, and the majority in Israel want us to be one nation.""  Lapid asserts that it is Israel's responsibility to recognize all streams of Judaism, including streams which don't follow Orthodox Jewish Law. 
 Lapid is a leading proponent of a deep bipartisan  . He has upbraided Netanyahu for alienating American Democrats: ""The fact that the [Israeli] government completely identifies with the conservative, evangelical faction of the Republican party is dangerous."" 
 When Jewish Democratic Congressman  's request to attend the embassy opening in Jerusalem was ignored, Lapid said, ""There's no way the government of Israel didn't notice this. It's the job of the Prime Minister's office to look at the list and say: We are nonpartisan and are not just attached to Republicans."" 
 During the 2013 election campaign, Lapid spoke of ""equal shares of the burden"" for all Israeli citizens. He said he would work to see all Israeli citizens, including the thousands of  , who had up until that point been exempt from most civil service, be included in military and civil service.  On 27 May 2013, Lapid threatened to topple the government unless ultra-Orthodox would be subject to criminal sanctions for draft-dodging. In the view of some Haredim, Lapid's plan represents a ""spiritual holocaust"", as they believe that their Jewish studies are what upholds Israel. Some Haredim have declared that even at the risk of being criminals, they will continue in their Jewish studies and refuse to enlist or perform civilian service.  Lapid denied that he was seeking to destroy the Haredi way of life, saying: ""Not one of us wishes, Heaven forbid, to force hiloniyut [secularism] on you or to impose our version of Israeli identity. This state was established so that Jews could be Jews, and live as Jews, without having to fear anyone."" 
 Lapid is a vocal opponent of the  , which seeks to economically isolate Israel. He has said, ""We can no longer abandon this battle to the haters of Israel. We need to defend Israel's good name in the world. They are besmirching us, and the time has come to answer them."" Lapid has also helped college students in America oppose BDS. 
 Lapid has spoken out vehemently about alleged   bias against Israel. In an op-ed, he excoriated the   for voting for ""61 resolutions condemning human rights abuses across the world, and 67 resolutions which condemned Israel"" in the past decade and having its own agenda item on Israel. Lapid blames   for ""erasing Jewish history"". 
 Lapid traces the UN's alleged bias against Israel to the creation of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine (UNRWA) in 1950, which services only   and gives them hereditary status so that the number of refugees has expanded from approximately 750,000 to five million. 
 Lapid has also indicated that if the media presents both sides of the story, or is objective then they serve Hamas, and only provide one side of the story when he said:
 ""If international media is objective it serves Hamas. If it just shows both sides it serves Hamas. My argument is that the media can't just claim to bring both sides of the story. If you do that you are only bringing one. Hamas' side.
 That's cowardly and that's it's lazy, it's an insult insult to the victims, including the Palestinian victims. It's also an insult to the core idea of what journalism is. Believe me I know, I was a journalist for 31 years.
 
I have no problem with criticism of Israel, but when you know that one side lies and one side makes every effort to verify the facts, the least we can expect is that you don't give a never-ending platform to their lies."" Lapid, whose father was a   survivor, spoke out against  's controversial  , which would criminalize accusing the Polish nation of being complicit in the Holocaust. Lapid said: ""No Polish law will change history. Poland was complicit in the Holocaust. Hundreds of thousands of Jews were murdered on its soil without them having met any German officer.""  He added that his ""grandmother was murdered in Poland by Germans and Poles"".  Lapid also wrote that there were "" "". The   stated that Lapid's claims about alleged Polish cooperation in the Holocaust were a ""conscious lie"" and that Lapid was ""using Holocaust as a political game"" that mocked the victims, also likening his allegation to the claims made by  . 
 In February 2018, Polish Prime Minister   said that ""there were Jewish perpetrators"" of the Holocaust, ""not only German perpetrators"".  Lapid condemned Morawiecki's words, saying: ""The perpetrators are not the victims. The Jewish state will not allow the murdered to be blamed for their own murder."" 
 Lapid's book   chronicles his father's life and observations as Israel evolved over its first sixty years. 
 In April 2013, Lapid appeared on  's list of ""100 Most Influential People in the World 2013"" in the category Leaders.  The following month, he ranked first on the list of the ""Most Influential Jews in the World"" by  .  He also was listed as one of the ""Foreign Policy Global Thinkers 2013"".",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8c/Extended-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Extended-protection-shackle.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Yair_Lapid_%28D1237-011%29.jpg/220px-Yair_Lapid_%28D1237-011%29.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Yair_Lapid%2C_Bamahane_issue_12.jpg/170px-Yair_Lapid%2C_Bamahane_issue_12.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Over_The_Ocean_third.jpg/220px-Over_The_Ocean_third.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/%D7%99%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8_%D7%9C%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%93_-_%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%A1_%D7%A9%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%9C%D7%94_%D7%94%D7%90%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8-2.JPG/220px-%D7%99%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8_%D7%9C%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%93_-_%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%A1_%D7%A9%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%9C%D7%94_%D7%94%D7%90%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8-2.JPG|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Blue_and_White1.jpg/220px-Blue_and_White1.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Yair_Lapid_meeting_with_Reuven_Rivlin_against_the_background_of_the_efforts_to_form_a_new_government_of_Israel%2C_May_2021_%28GPOZAC_7336%29.jpg/220px-Yair_Lapid_meeting_with_Reuven_Rivlin_against_the_background_of_the_efforts_to_form_a_new_government_of_Israel%2C_May_2021_%28GPOZAC_7336%29.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/President_Joe_Biden_meets_with_leaders_of_India%2C_Israel%2C_and_the_United_Arab_Emirates.jpg/220px-President_Joe_Biden_meets_with_leaders_of_India%2C_Israel%2C_and_the_United_Arab_Emirates.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/20px-Commons-logo.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg/27px-Wikinews-logo.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/23px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/26px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Flag_of_Israel.svg/21px-Flag_of_Israel.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Emblem_of_Israel.svg/40px-Emblem_of_Israel.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Flag_of_Israel.svg/21px-Flag_of_Israel.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Flag_of_Israel.svg/21px-Flag_of_Israel.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Emblem_of_Israel.svg/40px-Emblem_of_Israel.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Emblem_of_Israel.svg/40px-Emblem_of_Israel.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yair_Lapid
en.wikipedia.org,Yahya Sinwar - Wikipedia,"( :  ,  , born October 29 1962), also spelled  ,  is a Palestinian politician who has been leader of  , the     political and military organization that rules the  , since 2017. 
 He was born in the   in   in 1962 to a family who had been   from   during the  .  He finished his studies at the   where he received a bachelor's degree in   Studies. 
 For orchestrating the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians he considered to be collaborators in 1989, he was sentenced to four life sentences by Israel, of which he served 22 years until his release among 1,026 others in a 2011   for Israeli soldier  .  Sinwar was one of the co-founders of the security apparatus of Hamas.  In 2017, he was elected the leader of Hamas, and claimed to pursue ""peaceful, popular resistance"" to the   the following year, a position which was later abandoned.  He was re-elected as the leader of Hamas in 2021, and was subject to an assassination attempt by Israel that year.
 In September 2015, Sinwar was   by the United States government,  and Hamas and the   have also been designated terrorist organisations by the United States, the European Union and other countries. Sinwar is regarded as the mastermind behind the   on 7 October 2023.  
 Sinwar was born   in 1962, in the  , when the Gaza Strip was under Egyptian rule, where he spent his early years. His family were   from   (Ashkelon) during the  , and sought refuge in the Gaza Strip. After he graduated from high school at Khan Yunis Secondary School for Boys, he went on to the   where he received a bachelor's degree in   Studies.  His younger brother is  , who is a military leader in Hamas.
 Sinwar was first arrested in 1982 for subversive activities and he served several months in the   prison where he met other Palestinian activists, including  , and dedicated himself to the Palestinian cause.  Arrested again in 1985,  upon his release he together with Rawhi Mushtaha co-founded the   (Majd), an organization that worked, among others, to identify collaborators with Israel among the Palestinian population,  which in 1987 became the ""police"" of Hamas.  
 Sinwar's killing of suspected collaborators with Israel gained him the nickname ""The Butcher of Khan Yunis"". 
 In 1988, Sinwar planned the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers and the murder of four Palestinians whom he suspected of cooperating with Israel. He was arrested on February that year; during questioning he admitted to strangling two of the victims, inadvertently killing another during a  , and accidentally shooting the fourth during an attempted abduction, and showed investigators an orchard where the four bodies were buried.  He was sentenced to four life sentences in 1989.  He tried to escape several times but was always caught. 
 In 2008, while serving a prison sentence, he was operated on by Israeli doctors  to remove a tumor in his brain to save his life.  Sinwar served 22 years of his sentence, and was the most senior Palestinian prisoner freed among 1,026 others in a 2011   for IDF soldier  , who had been held hostage by Hamas for five years. 
 In November 2012, during the  , Sinwar met Iranian     General   in   and after his 2017 election as the group's leader in Gaza he cultivated closer cooperation between Hamas,   and Iran.  In 2015, he is believed to have overseen the torture and execution of fellow Hamas commander Mahmoud Ishtiwi, who was accused of   and  .  Ishtwi was reportedly whipped, suspended from a ceiling for hours across multiple days, and ultimately killed by being shot with three bullets to the chest.  
 In February 2017 Sinwar was secretly elected the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, taking over from  . In March, he established a Hamas-controlled administrative committee for the Gaza Strip, which meant that he opposed any power sharing with the   in  . Sinwar rejects any reconciliation with Israel.  He has called on militants to capture more Israeli soldiers.  In September 2017, a new round of negotiations with the Palestinian Authority began in Egypt, and Sinwar agreed to dissolve the Hamas administrative committee for Gaza.  More recently he has silenced hard-line voices in Gaza, ordering against the use of tunnels that   wanted to use to sneak fighters into Israel before they were shut down by new classified Israeli technology in 2017. 
 On 16 May 2018, in an unexpected announcement on Al Jazeera, Sinwar stated that Hamas would pursue ""peaceful, popular resistance"" to the  , opening the possibility that Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organisation by many countries, may play a role in negotiations with Israel.  A week earlier he had encouraged Gazans to breach the Israeli siege, saying ""We would rather die as martyrs than die out of oppression and humiliation"", and adding, ""We are ready to die, and tens of thousands will die with us."" 
 On 1 December 2020, Sinwar tested positive for   and was reportedly following the advice of health authorities and taking precautionary measures. A spokesman for the group also said that he was in ""good health and [...] pursuing his duties as usual."" 
 In March 2021, he was elected to a second four-year term as the head of Hamas Gaza branch in an election held in secret. He is the highest-ranking Hamas official in Gaza and Gaza's   ruler, as well as the second most powerful member of Hamas after Haniyeh. 
 On 15 May 2021, an Israeli airstrike was reported to have hit the home of the Hamas leader; there were no immediate details of any deaths or injured. The strike took place in the Khan Yunis region of southern Gaza in the midst of evergrowing  .  However, in the week that followed, he appeared publicly at least four times. The most obvious and daring thereof was in a press conference on 27 May 2021, when he mentioned (on air) that he will go home after the press conference (on foot), and invited the   to take the decision to assassinate him in the following 60 minutes, until he reaches his home. Sinwar spent the next hour wandering in Gaza streets and having selfie photos with the public. 
 Sinwar—along with  —is regarded as the mastermind behind the   on 7 October 2023, the deadliest attack in Israeli history.  The attack left around 1,200 people dead and about 240 taken as hostages in Gaza. Following the attack, Sinwar was put under   terrorist sanctions  and became a top target for assassination by the Israeli military.  Israeli intelligence presumes Sinwar is hiding in a   and is surrounded by hostages acting as  . 
 After three weeks of conflict in the  , Sinwar proposed the release of all Palestinian prisoners in Israeli confinement in exchange for the release of all  .  Sinwar reportedly visited the hostages in the early days of the war promising they would not be harmed.  When one of the hostages,  Yocheved Lifshitz, said Sinwar should be ashamed of himself, he was silent. 
 On November 7, after Israel had surrounded  , it claimed it had ""trapped"" Sinwar in a bunker there.  Israeli military authorities later claimed he is in   in an underground bunker.  Leaflets allegedly dropped by Israel into Gaza proclaimed a bounty of $400,000 for providing information on Sinwar's location.  According to Reuters, Israel is demanding the exile of Sinwar, Deif, and four other Hamas leaders from Gaza as a condition for a ceasefire. 
 By February 2024 the IDF believed that Sinwar had moved to Rafah from Khan Younis. According to the IDF, Sinwar is constantly on the move and thus is unable to personally command Hamas forces.  On 13 February IDF released CCTV footage dated 10 October showing Sinwar and his wife and children as well as his brother Ibrahim in a Hamas tunnel complex in Khan Younis. IDF stated that they are collecting intelligence and interrogating Hamas commanders and their relatives to find Sinwar.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8c/Extended-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Extended-protection-shackle.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Yahya_al-Sinwar_2013_%28cropped%29.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/16px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar

en.wikipedia.org,Nature deficit disorder - Wikipedia,"is the idea that human beings, especially children, are spending less time outdoors than they have in the past, and the belief that this change results in a wide range of behavioral problems.
 This disorder is not recognized in any of the medical manuals for mental disorders, such as the   or the  . 
 This term was coined by   in 2005.  Louv does not intend the term ""disorder"" to represent an actual illness but instead intends the term to act as a metaphor describing the costs of alienation from nature.  Louv claims that causes for nature-deficit disorder include parental fears and restricted access to natural areas. 
 Elizabeth Dickinson has criticized the term as a misdiagnosis that obscures the problems of dysfunctional cultural practices. 
 Nature-deficit disorder is unrecognized by most medical institutions. Some preliminary research shows that lack of time outdoors does have negative effects on children's mental well-being. 
 Most research relating to nature-deficit disorder does not specifically mention it by name. Though studies on the impact of natural environments, particularly the concept of  , on mental and physical wellbeing often show supporting claims.
 Researchers have not assessed the causes of nature-deficit disorder. However, Richard Louv has proposed some causes:
 Redlining in the U.S. has led to more low-income and marginalized communities to have limited access to greenspace.  One review suggested that nature-deficit disorder may have an increased impact on these communities, although there has been inadequate research to determine any such effects conclusively. 
 Because nature-deficit disorder is not meant to be a medical diagnosis (and is not recognized as one), researchers have not assessed the effects of nature-deficit disorder.
 Louv believes that the effects of nature-deficit disorder on our children will have ""profound implications, not only for the health of future generations but for the health of the Earth itself"". 
 The   was created to encourage and support the people and organizations working to reconnect children with nature. Richard Louv is a co-founder of the Children & Nature Network.
 The   works to get children outside and actively learning. They hope to address the problem of nature-deficit disorder. They are now working on the  , which would increase environmental education in schools. The coalition claims the problem of nature-deficit disorder could be helped by ""igniting student's interest in the outdoors"" and encouraging them to explore the natural world in their own lives. 
 In Colombia, OpEPA (Organización para la Educación y Protección Ambiental)   has been working to increase time spent outdoors since 1998. OpEPA's mission is to reconnect children and youth to the Earth so they can act with environmental responsibility. OpEPA works by linking three levels of education: intellectual, experiencial and emotional/spiritual into outdoor experiences. Developing and training educators in the use of inquiry based learning, learning by play and experiential education is a key component to empower educators to engage in nature education.
 Elizabeth Dickinson, a business communication professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, studied nature-deficit disorder through a case study at the North Carolina Educational State Forest system (NCESF), a forest conservation education program. Dickinson argues that it is what Louv's narrative is missing that prevents nature-deficit disorder from effecting meaningful change. She attributes the problems described by nature-deficit disorder as coming not from a lack of children outside or in nature, but from adults' own ""psyche and dysfunctional cultural practices"". According to Dickinson, ""in the absence of deeper cultural examination and alternative practices, nature deficit disorder is a misdiagnosis—a problematic contemporary environmental discourse that can obscure and mistreat the problem.""
 Dickinson analyzed the language and discourses used at the NCESF (educators' messages, education and curriculum materials, forest service messages and literature, and the forests themselves) and compared them to Louv's discussion of nature-deficit disorder in his writings. She concluded that both Louv and the NCESF (both who loosely support each other) perpetuate the problematic idea that humans are outside of nature, and they use techniques that appear to get children more connected to nature but that may not.
 She suggests making it clear that modern culture's disassociation with nature has occurred gradually over time, rather than very recently. Dickinson thinks that many people idealize their own childhoods without seeing the dysfunction that has existed for multiple generations. She warns against viewing the cure to nature-deficit disorder as an outward entity: ""nature"". Instead, Dickinson states that a path of inward self-assessment ""with nature"" (rather than ""in nature"") and alongside meaningful time spent in nature is the key to solving the social and environmental problems of which nature-deficit disorder is a symptom. In addition, she advocates allowing nature education to take on an emotional pedagogy rather than a mainly scientific one, as well as experiencing nature as it is before ascribing names to everything.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-Ambox_important.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Children_playing_outdoors.jpg/220px-Children_playing_outdoors.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Rat_rock_2_020.jpg/220px-Rat_rock_2_020.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Ambox_current_red.svg/42px-Ambox_current_red.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_deficit_disorder

en.wikipedia.org,Euclidean vector - Wikipedia,"In  ,  , and  , a   or simply a   (sometimes called a   or  ) is a geometric object that has   (or  ) and  . Euclidean vectors can be added and scaled to form a  . A Euclidean vector is frequently represented by a  , or graphically as an arrow connecting an     with a    ,  and denoted by  
 A vector is what is needed to ""carry"" the point   to the point  ; the Latin word   means ""carrier"".  It was first used by 18th century astronomers investigating planetary revolution around the Sun.  The magnitude of the vector is the distance between the two points, and the direction refers to the direction of   from   to  . Many   on   such as  ,  ,  , and   have close analogues for vectors,  operations which obey the familiar algebraic laws of  ,  , and  . These operations and associated laws qualify   vectors as an example of the more generalized concept of vectors defined simply as elements of a  .
 Vectors play an important role in  : the   and   of a moving object and the   acting on it can all be described with vectors.  Many other physical quantities can be usefully thought of as vectors. Although most of them do not represent distances (except, for example,   or  ), their magnitude and direction can still be represented by the length and direction of an arrow. The mathematical representation of a physical vector depends on the   used to describe it. Other vector-like objects that describe   and transform in a similar way under changes of the coordinate system include   and  . 
 The vector concept, as it is known today, is the result of a gradual development over a period of more than 200 years. About a dozen people contributed significantly to its development.  In 1835,   abstracted the basic idea when he established the concept of  . Working in a Euclidean plane, he made equipollent any pair of   line segments of the same length and orientation. Essentially, he realized an   on the pairs of points (bipoints) in the plane, and thus erected the first space of vectors in the plane.  The term   was introduced by   as part of a  , which is a sum   of a     (also called  ) and a 3-dimensional  . Like Bellavitis, Hamilton viewed vectors as representative of   of equipollent directed segments. As   use an   to complement the  , Hamilton considered the vector   to be the   of a quaternion: 
 The algebraically imaginary part, being geometrically constructed by a straight line, or radius vector, which has, in general, for each determined quaternion, a determined length and determined direction in space, may be called the vector part, or simply the vector of the quaternion. Several other mathematicians developed vector-like systems in the middle of the nineteenth century,  including  ,  ,  ,  , and  . Grassmann's 1840 work   (Theory of the Ebb and Flow) was the first system of spatial analysis that is similar to today's system, and had ideas corresponding to the cross product, scalar product and vector differentiation. Grassmann's work was largely neglected until the 1870s.    carried the quaternion standard after Hamilton. His 1867   included extensive treatment of the nabla or   ∇. In 1878,   was published by  . Clifford simplified the quaternion study by isolating the   and   of two vectors from the complete quaternion product. This approach made vector calculations available to engineers—and others working in three dimensions and skeptical of the fourth.
 , who was exposed to quaternions through  's  , separated off their vector part for independent treatment. The first half of Gibbs's  , published in 1881, presents what is essentially the modern system of vector analysis.  In 1901,   published  , adapted from Gibbs's lectures, which banished any mention of quaternions in the development of vector calculus.
 In   and  , a vector is typically regarded as a geometric entity characterized by a   and a direction. It is formally defined as a directed  , or arrow, in a  .  In  , a vector is defined more generally as any element of a  . In this context, vectors are abstract entities which may or may not be characterized by a magnitude and a direction. This generalized definition implies that the above-mentioned geometric entities are a special kind of vectors, as they are elements of a special kind of vector space called  . This particular article is about vectors strictly defined as arrows in Euclidean space. When it becomes necessary to distinguish these special vectors from vectors as defined in pure mathematics, they are sometimes referred to as  ,  , or   vectors.
 Being an arrow, a Euclidean vector possesses a definite   and  . A vector with fixed initial and terminal point is called a  .  When only the magnitude and direction of the vector matter, then the particular initial point is of no importance, and the vector is called a  . Thus two arrows   and   in space represent the same free vector if they have the same magnitude and direction: that is, they are   if the quadrilateral   is a  . If the Euclidean space is equipped with a choice of  , then a free vector is equivalent to the bound vector of the same magnitude and direction whose initial point is the origin. The term   also has generalizations to higher dimensions, and to more formal approaches with much wider applications.
 In classical   (i.e.,  ), vectors were introduced (during the 19th century) as   under  , of   of points; two pairs   and   being equipollent if the points  , in this order, form a  . Such an equivalence class is called a  , more precisely, a Euclidean vector.  The equivalence class of   is often denoted  
 A Euclidean vector is thus an equivalence class of directed segments with the same magnitude (e.g., the length of the    ) and same direction (e.g., the direction from   to  ).  In physics, Euclidean vectors are used to represent physical quantities that have both magnitude and direction, but are not located at a specific place, in contrast to  , which have no direction.  For example,  ,   and   are represented by vectors.
 In modern geometry, Euclidean spaces are often defined from  . More precisely, a Euclidean space   is defined as a set to which is associated an   of finite dimension over the reals   and a   of the   of   which is   and   (See   for details of this construction). The elements of   are called  . It has been proven that the two definitions of Euclidean spaces are equivalent, and that the equivalence classes under equipollence may be identified with translations.
 Sometimes, Euclidean vectors are considered without reference to a Euclidean space. In this case, a Euclidean vector is an element of a normed vector space of finite dimension over the reals, or, typically, an element of   equipped with the  . This makes sense, as the addition in such a vector space acts freely and transitively on the vector space itself. That is,   is a Euclidean space, with itself as an associated vector space, and the dot product as an inner product.
 The Euclidean space   is often presented as   Euclidean space of dimension  . This is motivated by the fact that every Euclidean space of dimension   is   to the Euclidean space   More precisely, given such a Euclidean space, one may choose any point   as an  . By  , one may also find an   of the associated vector space (a basis such that the inner product of two basis vectors is 0 if they are different and 1 if they are equal). This defines   of any point   of the space, as the coordinates on this basis of the vector   These choices define an isomorphism of the given Euclidean space onto   by mapping any point to the   of its Cartesian coordinates, and every vector to its  .
 Since the physicist's concept of   has a direction and a magnitude, it may be seen as a vector. As an example, consider a rightward force   of 15  . If the positive   is also directed rightward, then   is represented by the vector 15 N, and if positive points leftward, then the vector for   is −15 N. In either case, the magnitude of the vector is 15 N. Likewise, the vector representation of a displacement Δ  of 4   would be 4 m or −4 m, depending on its direction, and its magnitude would be 4 m regardless.
 Vectors are fundamental in the physical sciences. They can be used to represent any quantity that has magnitude, has direction, and which adheres to the rules of vector addition. An example is  , the magnitude of which is  . For instance, the velocity   could be represented by the vector (0, 5) (in 2 dimensions with the positive  -axis as 'up'). Another quantity represented by a vector is  , since it has a magnitude and direction and follows the rules of vector addition.  Vectors also describe many other physical quantities, such as linear displacement,  , linear acceleration,  ,  , and  . Other physical vectors, such as the   and  , are represented as a system of vectors at each point of a physical space; that is, a  . Examples of quantities that have magnitude and direction, but fail to follow the rules of vector addition, are angular displacement and electric current. Consequently, these are not vectors.
 In the  , a bound vector can be represented by identifying the coordinates of its initial and terminal point. For instance, the points   and   in space determine the bound vector   pointing from the point   on the  -axis to the point   on the  -axis.
 In Cartesian coordinates, a free vector may be thought of in terms of a corresponding bound vector, in this sense, whose initial point has the coordinates of the origin  . It is then determined by the coordinates of that bound vector's terminal point. Thus the free vector represented by (1, 0, 0) is a vector of unit length—pointing along the direction of the positive  -axis.
 This coordinate representation of free vectors allows their algebraic features to be expressed in a convenient numerical fashion. For example, the sum of the two (free) vectors (1, 2, 3) and (−2, 0, 4) is the (free) vector
 In the geometrical and physical settings, it is sometimes possible to associate, in a natural way, a   or magnitude and a direction to vectors. In addition, the notion of direction is strictly associated with the notion of an   between two vectors. If the   of two vectors is defined—a scalar-valued product of two vectors—then it is also possible to define a length; the dot product gives a convenient algebraic characterization of both angle (a function of the dot product between any two non-zero vectors) and length (the square root of the dot product of a vector by itself). In three dimensions, it is further possible to define the  , which supplies an algebraic characterization of the   and   in space of the   defined by two vectors (used as sides of the parallelogram). In any dimension (and, in particular, higher dimensions), it is possible to define the  , which (among other things) supplies an algebraic characterization of the area and orientation in space of the  -dimensional   defined by   vectors.
 In a  , a vector's squared length can be positive, negative, or zero. An important example is   (which is important to our understanding of  ).
 However, it is not always possible or desirable to define the length of a vector. This more general type of spatial vector is the subject of   (for free vectors) and   (for bound vectors, as each represented by an ordered pair of ""points""). One physical example comes from  , where many quantities of interest can be considered vectors in a space with no notion of length or angle. 
 In physics, as well as mathematics, a vector is often identified with a   of components, or list of numbers, that act as scalar coefficients for a set of  . When the basis is transformed, for example by rotation or stretching, then the components of any vector in terms of that basis also transform in an opposite sense. The vector itself has not changed, but the basis has, so the components of the vector must change to compensate. The vector is called   or  , depending on how the transformation of the vector's components is related to the transformation of the basis. In general, contravariant vectors are ""regular vectors"" with units of distance (such as a displacement), or distance times some other unit (such as velocity or acceleration); covariant vectors, on the other hand, have units of one-over-distance such as  . If you change units (a special case of a  ) from meters to millimeters, a scale factor of 1/1000, a displacement of 1 m becomes 1000 mm—a contravariant change in numerical value. In contrast, a gradient of 1  /m becomes 0.001 K/mm—a covariant change in value (for more, see  ).   are another type of quantity that behave in this way; a vector is one type of  .
 In pure  , a vector is any element of a   over some   and is often represented as a  . The vectors described in this article are a very special case of this general definition, because they are contravariant with respect to the ambient space. Contravariance captures the physical intuition behind the idea that a vector has ""magnitude and direction"".
 Vectors are usually denoted in   boldface, as in   and  , or in lowercase italic boldface, as in  . (  letters are typically used to represent  .) Other conventions include   or  , especially in handwriting. Alternatively, some use a   (~) or a wavy underline drawn beneath the symbol, e.g.  , which is a convention for indicating boldface type. If the vector represents a directed   or   from a point   to a point   (see figure), it can also be denoted as   or  . In   literature, it was especially common to represent vectors with small   letters such as  .
 Vectors are usually shown in graphs or other diagrams as arrows (directed  ), as illustrated in the figure. Here, the point   is called the  ,  ,  , or  , and the point   is called the  ,  ,  ,   or  . The length of the arrow is proportional to the vector's  , while the direction in which the arrow points indicates the vector's direction.
 On a two-dimensional diagram, a vector   to the   of the diagram is sometimes desired. These vectors are commonly shown as small circles. A circle with a dot at its centre (Unicode U+2299 ⊙) indicates a vector pointing out of the front of the diagram, toward the viewer. A circle with a cross inscribed in it (Unicode U+2297 ⊗) indicates a vector pointing into and behind the diagram. These can be thought of as viewing the tip of an   head on and viewing the flights of an arrow from the back.
 In order to calculate with vectors, the graphical representation may be too cumbersome. Vectors in an  -dimensional Euclidean space can be represented as   in a  . The endpoint of a vector can be identified with an ordered list of   real numbers ( - ). These numbers are the   of the endpoint of the vector, with respect to a given  , and are typically called the   (or  ) of the vector on the axes of the coordinate system.
 As an example in two dimensions (see figure), the vector from the origin   = (0, 0) to the point   = (2, 3) is simply written as
 The notion that the tail of the vector coincides with the origin is implicit and easily understood. Thus, the more explicit notation   is usually deemed not necessary (and is indeed rarely used).
 In   Euclidean space (or  ), vectors are identified with triples of scalar components:
 This can be generalised to   Euclidean space (or  ).
 These numbers are often arranged into a   or  , particularly when dealing with  , as follows:
 Another way to represent a vector in  -dimensions is to introduce the   vectors. For instance, in three dimensions, there are three of them:
 or
 where  ,  ,   are called the   (or  ) of   on the basis vectors or, equivalently, on the corresponding Cartesian axes  ,  , and   (see figure), while  ,  ,   are the respective   (or scalar projections).
 In introductory physics textbooks, the standard basis vectors are often denoted   instead (or  , in which the     typically denotes  ). In this case, the scalar and vector components are denoted respectively  ,  ,  , and  ,  ,   (note the difference in boldface). Thus,
 The notation   is compatible with the   and the   commonly used in higher level mathematics, physics, and engineering.
 As explained  , a vector is often described by a set of vector components that   to form the given vector. Typically, these components are the   of the vector on a set of mutually perpendicular reference axes (basis vectors). The vector is said to be   or   that set.
 The decomposition or resolution  of a vector into components is not unique, because it depends on the choice of the axes on which the vector is projected.
 Moreover, the use of Cartesian unit vectors such as   as a   in which to represent a vector is not mandated. Vectors can also be expressed in terms of an arbitrary basis, including the unit vectors of a   ( ) or   ( ). The latter two choices are more convenient for solving problems which possess cylindrical or spherical symmetry, respectively.
 The choice of a basis does not affect the properties of a vector or its behaviour under transformations.
 A vector can also be broken up with respect to ""non-fixed"" basis vectors that change their   as a function of time or space. For example, a vector in three-dimensional space can be decomposed with respect to two axes, respectively  , and   to a surface (see figure). Moreover, the   and   of a vector relate to the   of an object. The former is   to the radius and the latter is   to it. 
 In these cases, each of the components may be in turn decomposed with respect to a fixed coordinate system or basis set (e.g., a   coordinate system, or  ).
 The following section uses the   with basis vectors
 Two vectors are said to be equal if they have the same magnitude and direction. Equivalently they will be equal if their coordinates are equal. So two vectors
 Two vectors are   if they have the same magnitude but  . So two vectors
 and
 are opposite if
 Two vectors are   if they have the same direction but not necessarily the same magnitude, or   if they have opposite direction but not necessarily the same magnitude. 
 The sum of   and   of two vectors may be defined as
 The addition may be represented graphically by placing the tail of the arrow   at the head of the arrow  , and then drawing an arrow from the tail of   to the head of  . The new arrow drawn represents the vector   +  , as illustrated below: 
 This addition method is sometimes called the   because   and   form the sides of a   and   +   is one of the diagonals. If   and   are bound vectors that have the same base point, this point will also be the base point of   +  . One can check geometrically that   +   =   +   and (  +  ) +   =   + (  +  ).
 The difference of   and   is
 Subtraction of two vectors can be geometrically illustrated as follows: to subtract   from  , place the tails of   and   at the same point, and then draw an arrow from the head of   to the head of  . This new arrow represents the vector   +  , with   being the opposite of   ,  see drawing. And   +   =   −  .
 A vector may also be multiplied, or re- , by a    . In the context of  , these real numbers are often called   (from  ) to distinguish them from vectors. The operation of multiplying a vector by a scalar is called  . The resulting vector is
 Intuitively, multiplying by a scalar   stretches a vector out by a factor of  . Geometrically, this can be visualized (at least in the case when   is an integer) as placing   copies of the vector in a line where the endpoint of one vector is the initial point of the next vector.
 If   is negative, then the vector changes direction: it flips around by an angle of 180°. Two examples (  = −1 and   = 2) are given below:
 Scalar multiplication is   over vector addition in the following sense:  (  +  ) =   +   for all vectors   and   and all scalars  . One can also show that   −   =   + (−1) .
 The   or   or   of the vector   is denoted by ‖ ‖ or, less commonly, | |, which is not to be confused with the   (a scalar ""norm"").
 The length of the vector   can be computed with the  ,
 which is a consequence of the   since the basis vectors  ,  ,   are orthogonal unit vectors.
 This happens to be equal to the square root of the  , discussed below, of the vector with itself:
 A   is any vector with a length of one; normally unit vectors are used simply to indicate direction. A vector of arbitrary length can be divided by its length to create a unit vector.  This is known as   a vector. A unit vector is often indicated with a hat as in  .
 To normalize a vector  , scale the vector by the reciprocal of its length ‖ ‖. That is:
 The   is the vector with length zero. Written out in coordinates, the vector is  , and it is commonly denoted  ,  , or simply 0. Unlike any other vector, it has an arbitrary or indeterminate direction, and cannot be normalized (that is, there is no unit vector that is a multiple of the zero vector). The sum of the zero vector with any vector   is   (that is,  ).
 The   of two vectors   and   (sometimes called the  , or, since its result is a scalar, the  ) is denoted by   ∙   and is defined as:
 where   is the measure of the   between   and   (see   for an explanation of cosine). Geometrically, this means that   and   are drawn with a common start point, and then the length of   is multiplied with the length of the component of   that points in the same direction as  .
 The dot product can also be defined as the sum of the products of the components of each vector as
 The   (also called the   or  ) is only meaningful in three or   dimensions. The cross product differs from the dot product primarily in that the result of the cross product of two vectors is a vector. The cross product, denoted   ×  , is a vector perpendicular to both   and   and is defined as
 where   is the measure of the angle between   and  , and   is a unit vector   to both   and   which completes a   system. The right-handedness constraint is necessary because there exist   unit vectors that are perpendicular to both   and  , namely,   and (− ).
 The cross product   ×   is defined so that  ,  , and   ×   also becomes a right-handed system (although   and   are not necessarily  ). This is the  .
 The length of   ×   can be interpreted as the area of the parallelogram having   and   as sides.
 The cross product can be written as
 For arbitrary choices of spatial orientation (that is, allowing for left-handed as well as right-handed coordinate systems) the cross product of two vectors is a   instead of a vector (see below).
 The   (also called the   or  ) is not really a new operator, but a way of applying the other two multiplication operators to three vectors. The scalar triple product is sometimes denoted by (     ) and defined as:
 It has three primary uses. First, the absolute value of the box product is the volume of the   which has edges that are defined by the three vectors. Second, the scalar triple product is zero if and only if the three vectors are  , which can be easily proved by considering that in order for the three vectors to not make a volume, they must all lie in the same plane. Third, the box product is positive if and only if the three vectors  ,   and   are right-handed.
 In components ( ), if the three vectors are thought of as rows (or columns, but in the same order), the scalar triple product is simply the   of the 3-by-3   having the three vectors as rows
 The scalar triple product is linear in all three entries and anti-symmetric in the following sense:
 All examples thus far have dealt with vectors expressed in terms of the same basis, namely, the   basis { ,  ,  }. However, a vector can be expressed in terms of any number of different bases that are not necessarily aligned with each other, and still remain the same vector.  In the   basis, a vector   is expressed, by definition, as
 The scalar components in the   basis are, by definition,
 In another orthonormal basis   = { ,  ,  } that is not necessarily aligned with  , the vector   is expressed as
 and the scalar components in the   basis are, by definition,
 The values of  ,  ,  , and  ,  ,   relate to the unit vectors in such a way that the resulting vector sum is exactly the same physical vector   in both cases.  It is common to encounter vectors known in terms of different bases (for example, one basis fixed to the Earth and a second basis fixed to a moving vehicle).  In such a case it is necessary to develop a method to convert between bases so the basic vector operations such as addition and subtraction can be performed.  One way to express  ,  ,   in terms of  ,  ,   is to use column matrices along with a   containing the information that relates the two bases.  Such an expression can be formed by substitution of the above equations to form
 Distributing the dot-multiplication gives
 Replacing each dot product with a unique scalar gives
 and these equations can be expressed as the single matrix equation
 This matrix equation relates the scalar components of   in the   basis ( , , and  ) with those in the   basis ( ,  , and  ).  Each matrix element   is the   relating   to  .  The term   refers to the   of the angle between two unit vectors, which is also equal to their  .  Therefore,
 By referring collectively to  ,  ,   as the   basis and to  ,  ,   as the   basis, the matrix containing all the   is known as the ""  from   to  "", or the ""  from   to  "" (because it can be imagined as the ""rotation"" of a vector from one basis to another), or the ""  from   to  ""  (because it contains direction cosines).  The properties of a   are such that its   is equal to its  . This means that the ""rotation matrix from   to  "" is the transpose of ""rotation matrix from   to  "".
 The properties of a direction cosine matrix, C are: 
 The advantage of this method is that a direction cosine matrix can usually be obtained independently by using   or a   to relate the two vector bases, so the basis conversions can be performed directly, without having to work out all the dot products described above.
 By applying several matrix multiplications in succession, any vector can be expressed in any basis so long as the set of direction cosines is known relating the successive bases. 
 With the exception of the cross and triple products, the above formulae generalise to two dimensions and higher dimensions. For example, addition generalises to two dimensions as 
 The cross product does not readily generalise to other dimensions, though the closely related   does, whose result is a  . In two dimensions this is simply a  
 A   is similar to the cross product in that its result is a vector orthogonal to the two arguments; there is however no natural way of selecting one of the possible such products.
 Vectors have many uses in physics and other sciences.
 In abstract vector spaces, the length of the arrow depends on a    . If it represents, for example, a force, the ""scale"" is of   length/force. Thus there is typically consistency in scale among quantities of the same dimension, but otherwise scale ratios may vary; for example, if ""1 newton"" and ""5 m"" are both represented with an arrow of 2 cm, the scales are 1 m:50 N and 1:250 respectively. Equal length of vectors of different dimension has no particular significance unless there is some   inherent in the system that the diagram represents. Also length of a unit vector (of dimension length, not length/force, etc.) has no coordinate-system-invariant significance.
 Often in areas of physics and mathematics, a vector evolves in time, meaning that it depends on a time parameter  . For instance, if   represents the position vector of a particle, then  ( ) gives a   representation of the trajectory of the particle. Vector-valued functions can be   and   by differentiating or integrating the components of the vector, and many of the familiar rules from   continue to hold for the derivative and integral of vector-valued functions.
 The position of a point   = ( ,  ,  ) in three-dimensional space can be represented as a   whose base point is the origin
 Given two points   = ( ,  ,  ),   = ( ,  ,  ) their   is a vector
 The     of a point or particle is a vector, its length gives the  . For constant velocity the position at time   will be
    of a point is vector which is the   of velocity. Its dimensions are length/time .

 Work is the dot product of   and  
 An alternative characterization of Euclidean vectors, especially in physics, describes them as lists of quantities which behave in a certain way under a  . A   is required to have components that ""transform opposite to the basis"" under changes of  . The vector itself does not change when the basis is transformed; instead, the components of the vector make a change that cancels the change in the basis. In other words, if the reference axes (and the basis derived from it) were rotated in one direction, the component representation of the vector would rotate in the opposite way to generate the same final vector. Similarly, if the reference axes were stretched in one direction, the components of the vector would reduce in an exactly compensating way. Mathematically, if the basis undergoes a transformation described by an    , so that a coordinate vector   is transformed to  , then a contravariant vector   must be similarly transformed via  . This important requirement is what distinguishes a contravariant vector from any other triple of physically meaningful quantities. For example, if   consists of the  ,  , and  -components of  , then   is a contravariant vector: if the coordinates of space are stretched, rotated, or twisted, then the components of the velocity transform in the same way. On the other hand, for instance, a triple consisting of the length, width, and height of a rectangular box could make up the three components of an abstract  , but this vector would not be contravariant, since rotating the box does not change the box's length, width, and height. Examples of contravariant vectors include  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .
 In the language of  , the requirement that the components of a vector transform according to the same matrix of the coordinate transition is equivalent to defining a   to be a   of   rank one. Alternatively, a contravariant vector is defined to be a  , and the rules for transforming a contravariant vector follow from the  .
 Some vectors transform like contravariant vectors, except that when they are reflected through a mirror, they flip   gain a minus sign. A transformation that switches right-handedness to left-handedness and vice versa like a mirror does is said to change the   of space. A vector which gains a minus sign when the orientation of space changes is called a   or an  . Ordinary vectors are sometimes called   or   to distinguish them from pseudovectors. Pseudovectors occur most frequently as the   of two ordinary vectors.
 One example of a pseudovector is  . Driving in a  , and looking forward, each of the   has an angular velocity vector pointing to the left. If the world is reflected in a mirror which switches the left and right side of the car, the   of this angular velocity vector points to the right, but the   angular velocity vector of the wheel still points to the left, corresponding to the minus sign. Other examples of pseudovectors include  ,  , or more generally any cross product of two (true) vectors.
 This distinction between vectors and pseudovectors is often ignored, but it becomes important in studying   properties.

en.wikipedia.org,Cities (The Cat Empire album) - Wikipedia,"is the third   by Australian band  , released on 1 April 2006 through  . The album consists of music recorded for the band's performance at the   the previous month.  A limited release, 10,000 individually numbered copies have been made in   format. It was released less than a year after their previous album,  .
 At the 2006 Fine Arts Awards, the album won an   under the category  . 
 The album was recorded at Sing Sing Studios in  ,  ,  .
 The band states the following about   on their website  – ""This project is somewhere in between a tribute to our own city and an experiment in sounds that we’ve found abroad. The approach to this record was far less precious than it was for our debut and Two Shoes. It was a kind of surprise record we almost didn’t expect to make. We wrote the material very quickly, and had an excellent and robust few weeks recording it. The record is in some ways serious and in some ways stupendous. There are ethnics, locals, sad songs, adventure songs, musical chorus’, screamers, and a collection of soul references. There are strings sections, Sitars, Tablas, horn sections, short punchy arrangements as well as some excellent solos. It is the kind of recording in which people might get to hear a different side of the Cat Empire, but it's still soulful, strange, humorous, whimsical, sometimes sad, sometimes delirious, mis-placed and undoubtedly Catempiracle as well.""

en.wikipedia.org,Wikipedia: WP:Athlete is not exclusionary - Wikipedia,"Many   on sports figures are often begun with a phrase such as the following:
 There are several faults with this statement, first and foremost is that   is a guideline and not a policy, secondly that simply making a statement without supporting information is not the best approach in the discussion, and thirdly that another editor may interpret the guidelines differently and find that the guideline is actually met.  But the fourth reason is that the statement (or argument) seems to take the stance that since the article does not met the   guidelines, it must be deleted.
 Let's be clear:    doesn't meet the guidelines of  , but that doesn't mean the article on him should be deleted. Athletes can achieve notability through other means, as   and   did.  Or, athletes who haven't met any guidelines of   such as ""not playing at the highest professional level"" could nevertheless have enough widespread significant coverage to qualify under the  .
 The   guidelines are meant to be ""inclusive"" and not ""exclusive"": Meeting them suffices for inclusion, but failure to meet them is not grounds for exclusion. Several pertinent discussions illustrating this principle:
 On the opposite side of the spectrum, many AfDs also see arguments such as the following:
 Some editors, though, believe that meeting WP:ATHLETE should not automatically qualify an individual for inclusion, if that individual does not otherwise meet the  , particularly in cases where an individual only ever played in one professional game (or even just a few minutes of one professional game) and nothing more can be said about them; WP:ATHLETE is only a guideline, whereas   is a policy, and sometimes it   be necessary to think critically about the guideline in order to uphold the ""spirit"" of Wikipedia standards rather than the letter of it. 
 This stance is controversial, however. Many editors believe WP:ATHLETE should be upheld even in cases such as those described above, for several reasons (even if the athlete only played in one pro game, there may be coverage of their college or amateur careers; because making exceptions to WP:ATHLETE would undermine the objective standard we have now and replace it with an arbitrary one; etc.)—see, for example,  .",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Essay.svg/30px-Essay.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Walnut.png/30px-Walnut.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WP:Athlete_is_not_exclusionary

 Hi, I was trying to find info about  . According to a newspaper ( , 27 Oct 1894), the head coach for Washburn in 1894 was Arthur Cane. An 1895 newspaper referred to Arthur Kane as the previous year's football coach. Other sources refer to Arthur Kane as a referee so it seems to be spelled with a K. I can't find any mention of a Gains or Gaines associated with Washburn or football. This conflicts with the official Washburn list used as a reference and so the current info seems dubious.   03:54, 1 March 2024 (UTC)

HSP replaces dedicated   or   hardware by using the general purpose   of the host computer.
 Modems using HSP are known as   (a term trademarked by 3COM / USRobotics, but genericized) or  . Printers using HSP are known as   (after the MS Windows GDI software interface),   (named after winmodems) or  .
 The     floppy drive used the host CPU to process drive control signals, instead of a  . This instance of HSP predates the usage of the terms HSP and NSP.
 In the mid- to late-1990s, Intel pursued native signal processing technology to improve multimedia handling.  According to testimony by Intel, Microsoft opposed development of NSP because the technology could reduce the necessity of the   operating system.  Intel claims to have terminated development of NSP because of threats from Microsoft.

 This project deals with a lot of television related articles, but they are not all the same. Therefore we have created separate pages with information for each type of television related article.
 See these   for examples of well written articles on characters and elements from fiction:
 There is no guideline or policy about naming an article about a fictional character. See the essay  .
 Actors, producers, writers etc. are all real people. Turn to   for help on writing such articles. Here are some quick guidelines and tips for you however.
 As a rule do not create categories for ""People  "", because they can potentially work on numerous series or movies etc. You should categorize by profession. See the higher level  ,  ,  ,  ,   in the top level  .
  images on pages of real people that are still alive are not allowed, because these images are replaceable. You also cannot use an image from a television program,  , because you are not illustrating the character but the actor.

en.wikipedia.org,Wikipedia:Public domain image resources - Wikipedia,"is a copy of the master Wikipedia page at  , which lists a number of sources of   images on the Web.
 Public Domain images should be marked with the Public Domain Mark 1.0. Public Domain Mark enables works that are no longer restricted by copyright to be marked as such in a standard and simple way, making them easily discoverable and available to others. The Public Domain Mark is recommended for works that are free of known copyright around the world. These will typically be very old works. 
For a creator to release their works into the public domain legally they must use the creative commons CC0 license which gives creators a way to waive all their copyright and related rights in their works to the fullest extent allowed by law. 
The presence of a resource on this list does not guarantee that all or any of the images in it are in the public domain. You are still responsible for checking the   status of images before you submit them to Wikipedia.
 Please read the policy on image use and etiquette at:  .

It can also help with finding freely licensed animations, audio and videos.
 Public Domain resources should have either the Public Domain Mark 1.0 or the CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication mark visible. Non-Public Domain resources should not be added to this list. Listing is ordered alphabetically.
 Note: Accurate photographs of two-dimensional visual artworks lack expressive content and are automatically in the public domain once the artwork's copyright has expired (which it has in the US if it was published before 1923). All other copyright notices can safely be ignored.

 , I see nothing in the guidelines you refer to that says what tense should be used. You have also failed to comply with other guidelines that state the historic county of a place can be mentioned in the lead. Refering to the historic county in the present tense does not contravene the guidelines you mention because the tense used is a grammatical, not a factual, matter. Past events can be mentoned with a present tense if the context allows, which in this case it does. I have inserted a rather pointless citation to illustrate the point. It refers specifically to other parts of London but the point of the citation is the tense used, which relates directly to your argument. BTW, please do not revert detail referenced with a reliable secondary source, which this is. To avoid doubt, this reference was published in 1996, well after 1974, or 1965.

 It has been made absolutely clear the policy we've settled on is not to put history in the present tense. I'd support pursuing a topic ban at this point.

To a modern-day reader, these subtleties will not be obvious, and they may be better served with a descriptive title.

en.wikipedia.org,Wikipedia:Wikipedia logos - Wikipedia,"had a series of   in its history before arriving at the current puzzle logo.
 Wikipedia's first true logo was an image that was originally submitted by   for a   logo competition which took place in 2000.  It continued to be used after this time on Special Pages, such as search results.
 The logo included a quote from the   of the 1879 book   by  ; due to the   effect, only part of the text can be read:
  prove a failure sary to maintain throu  scientific writers usually   come to be regarded as an  ntific teaching. I never co leness of this immemorial law:  ubt, which are in their essence   lightness of treatment – but  try as one of them. Neverthe nd that I have permitted my  of things only at fitting sea  crave a moment’s In November 2001, Wikipedians began  . A   was chosen in the first Wikipedia logo contest, which took place from November to December 2001. The winner was the last logo (#24), contributed by  .
 The logo included the following quote, taken from  's 1651 book  ,  :
  man is distinguished, not only by his reason, but also by this singular passion from other animals;   which is a lust of the mind, that by a perseverance of delight in the continual and indefatigable generation of knowledge, exceedeth the short vehemence of any carnal pleasure. Because of its English text, this logo was not ideal for the Wikipedias in other languages. Some wikis chose a similar design with text in their own languages (e.g. the   that used a text from the classic book  ). Others used the English logo but added the color of a national flag (most of the   language projects,  , for example) or simply a translation of ""The Free Encyclopedia"" (e.g.  ). Still others designed a completely different logo (e.g. the  ).
 Following a   by  , an   was conducted to find a new logo that was suitable for all languages. After a two-stage vote, a design by   (at the time known as  ) won with considerable support. The   switched to it on September 26, 2003.
 Stansifer's logo depicted a  , of multiple colors. Covered by text with links, the logo was to symbolize the continuous construction and development of the project. The logo was made in  , using a   wrapped around a sphere. The   file is available  .
 A ratification vote was held soon after, to confirm community consensus. As a result,   of the design were created by members of the community.
 One of David Friedland's ( )  , occasionally referred to as the ""silver ball"", was soon chosen. The revision of Stansifer's concept removed the color and changed the overlaid text into one letter or symbol per puzzle piece. Both Friedland and Stansifer have assigned copyrights to the logo to the  .
 Whilst symbolizing a globe the new logo also loosely resembled a   as used in some  , a former metaphor for the liberation of the process of professional writing.
 There was some controversy over switching the English Wikipedia to this logo for several reasons, one of which was the fact Wikipedia's servers were flickering throughout most of the process.
 Before being released to all Wikipedias, the logo was lightened up slightly.
 After the  , a column in   insinuated the logo as being a metaphor for the entire project.   wrote ""Just above the omega, at the point where, on human heads, they used to perform frontal lobotomies, bits of the jigsaw are missing.""
 The puzzle logo includes 16 letters from 16 different alphabets, many of which—but not all—represent a letter from that alphabet that most closely resembles the English ""W"", as in ""Wikipedia"". The alphabets represented are as follows:
 There have, over the years, been suggestions that some of these characters should be changed to reflect the actual spellings of ""Wikipedia"" in various languages. 
 In late 2009, the Wikimedia Foundation undertook to fix some errors that had been noted in the design of the puzzle globe. In particular, it did not scale well and some letters appeared distorted.  For the new logo, the Wikimedia Foundation defined which characters appear on the ""hidden"" puzzle pieces, and had a three-dimensional computer model of the globe created to allow the generation of other views.
 The new logo was unveiled in May 2010. It is commonly referred to as ""v2"" or ""2.0"", since it represents the second (official) version of the puzzle globe logo to be adopted. It features the new 3D rendering of the puzzle globe, with corrected characters (and the   character replaced by a   character).  The   has been modified from the   font to the open-source   font, and the subtitle is no longer italicized. The only error is that the Khmer letter ""vo+i"" is lying on its side instead of being straight. It's most likely that this error will not be fixed.
 The   has more information on the unveiling, and the   has more detailed information on the new logo.
 On January 15, 2011, a special logo replaced the standard globe in order to mark the tenth anniversary of Wikipedia's founding. The logo depicts a single jigsaw piece, representing the addition of another piece to the puzzle.
 On January 14, 2021, a 4-sectioned logo was used instead of the puzzle globe, in order to mark the 20th anniversary of Wikipedia. The 4 sections depict, from top-to-bottom, left-to-right:
 Yellow background, a woman reading a book with the ""W"" on it, signifying Wikipedia.
Blue background, a computer showing a blue screen with a ""W"" on it, signifying Wikipedia.
Red background, a phone showing a blue screen with a ""W"" on it, signifying Wikipedia.
Finally, on green background, the normal Wikipedia globe, in blue, but with most letters aside from the ""W"" being replaced with various other objects and symbols.
 Some users complained about the visual notoriety of the logo which was found to be striking in contrast to the remainder of the Wikipedia site.
 On the Czech Wikipedia, a different ""cake"" logo is shown, with 2, W, O, stuck in the cake.
 On January 22, 2021, the previous 20th anniversary logo was replaced with a less striking version, consisting of the normative Wikipedia globe above the text ""20 years of Wikipedia - Over One Billion Edits"".
 The first two versions of the logo were made to resemble a globe by the use of the  .
 The third version (puzzle ball logo) was made in  , a   program which generates 2D images from a 3D scene description. The   consisted of a sphere on which a   was  , as described  . Nohat's version introduced a   to the setup, to provide 3D   and simulate separate puzzle pieces.
 Truly   have been created in a few variations. One provides each puzzle piece sculpted independently, to allow alternative renderings; Files are available on GitHub   and  . Additional 3D printable versions are available in  .

 A very large  , dubbed the  , featured in  , depicted an approximation of the Wikipedia logo. A smaller version was distributed to the participants. The large ball was dismantled after the closing ceremony, and many participants kept a piece or more of the puzzle.
 In 2017, a concrete version of the logo was submerged in   to create an

en.wikipedia.org,Wikipedia:Navigation template - Wikipedia,"A   is a grouping of links used in multiple related articles to facilitate navigation between those articles. Editing of a navigation template is done in a central place, the template page.
 There are two main varieties of navigation template:   (or  ), designed to sit at the very bottom of articles, and  , designed to sit at the side of the article text. The two are complementary and either or both may be appropriate in different situations.
 The usual way to create navigation templates is to use the {{ }} or {{ }} master templates. This simplifies the process of creating a functional and consistent template.
  Navboxes are not displayed on the  , which accounts for around half of readers. See Phabricator ticket   for progress on the mobile issue. 
 Navboxes are categorized under  . Some   maintain a list of their navigation templates.
 The two main types of navigation template are navboxes and sidebars. The two serve similar purposes: to allow related subjects to link to each other easily in a consistent manner.
 
 The two types are used interchangeably, and either or both may be appropriate in different circumstances. The primary differences between the two are:
 The style of any navigation template depends on its articles, how they are most intuitively presented, and previously established convention.
 Advantages of using navigation templates rather than listing all the links under "" "" sections include:
 In certain cases, there are alternatives preferable over the creation of a new navigation template.
 There are   an article may have. When a page exceeds this limit it may look fine in preview but, after the edit is saved, one or more footer navboxes display as wikilinks to the now excess navboxes (for example, displaying a link to ""Template:Navbox"" rather than the Navbox template itself). Solutions for this problem include (a) removing a template, and (b) setting up the footer navboxes so the least important one becomes the ""extra"" navbox (the one the reader will have to navigate to a separate page to in order to view).",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1d/Information_icon4.svg/40px-Information_icon4.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Walnut.png/30px-Walnut.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Azimutalprojektion-schief_kl-cropped.png/120px-Azimutalprojektion-schief_kl-cropped.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/16px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Navigation_template

en.wikipedia.org,1st & Ten (graphics system) - Wikipedia,"is a   that   televised coverage of   by inserting graphical elements on the field of play as if they were physically present; the inserted element   of the playing field and obeys the visual rules of foreground objects occluding background objects. Developed by   and  , it is best known for generating and displaying a yellow   line over a live broadcast of a football game—making it easier for viewers to follow play on the field.  The line is not physically present on the field and is seen only by the television audience. 
 1st & Ten is sometimes used generically to refer to the class of systems capable of adding first down lines and similar visual elements and not just the Sportvision system. However, PVI's competing system is more accurately named L-VIS, for Live Video Insertion System. 
 Over time, usage has evolved. Some football broadcasts change the color of the line from yellow to red on 4th down, or show a second computer-generated line (usually blue in color) that marks the  . Lines can also be projected to show other types of field position, including markings for the   and the optimum maximum distance for a  's statistical   range.  In   situations, an entire virtual field with yard and boundary markers can be projected onto the field in order to allow league officials, broadcasters and viewers some way to follow action when all field markings are obscured by snow,   or mud. 
 The system makes use of a combination of motion sensors mounted on the broadcast cameras to record what they are viewing,  and/or the use of match moving computer graphics technology  and an enhanced version of   or ""green screen"" technology. 
 The idea of creating an on-field marker to help TV viewers identify first down distances was conceived and patented in 1978 by  ,  who presented the concept to   and   of ABC News and Sports and to the  . At the time, both decided the broadcast industry was not ready to use Crain's invention.  
 In 1998,   programmer   and others revived the idea. ESPN's   coordinating producer,  , was tasked with overseeing an implementation for his network.  The 1st & Ten line was first broadcast by  , a private company, during ESPN's coverage of a  -  game on September 27, 1998.   A few weeks later, on Thanksgiving Day in 1998,   (PVI) aired its version of the virtual yellow down line on a CBS broadcast of a  –  game.  Four years later,   introduced a third version during NBC coverage of a Notre Dame game.
 The rivalry between   and Sportvision began with a collaboration. In July 1995, PVI had successfully used its   (Live Video Insertion System)   technology to broadcast virtual advertising behind the home plate on a local broadcast of a   baseball game. In January 1996,  , director of special projects at PVI, saw Sportvision's   puck on the broadcast of the   and realized that a combination of L-VIS and FoxTrax would allow virtual insertions in a wider range of situations than either could do on its own, given the power of affordable computers. He contacted  ,   at Sportvision, and the two companies undertook a joint demonstration of their combined technologies during the   between the   and the   at the  . The test was not a success and the two companies parted ways, each developing complementary systems that were eventually used to broadcast Sportvision's ""First and Ten"" line and PVI's ""Yellow Down Line"".  In October 1999, SportVision sued PVI alleging that PVI's virtual signage, first down line and other products infringed Fox/Sportvision patents. In August 2001, PVI counterclaimed against Sportvision in the federal court action, alleging that Sportvision's virtual strike zone and virtual signage products infringed a PVI patent. In 2002, the companies settled the lawsuits out of court through a cross-licensing deal. 
 Each football field has a unique crown and contour and is not perfectly flat in order to facilitate  , so a 3D model is made of the field prior to the game.  Due to the low amount of change throughout a football season, this 3D model is usually only generated once a season at most. It also has a unique color palette, typically various shades of green, depending on the type of surface (i.e. real or   grass) and the weather (e.g. bright, shady or even snowing).  In addition, after cameras are set up, the position of the camera relative to the field is established to be used in conjunction with the previously created 3D model of the field.
 There are usually a number of cameras shooting the field, but typically only three or four main cameras are used for an American football broadcast (one on the fifty-yard line, and one on each twenty-yard line, with most high profile games also having a  , as described below). The cameras with video that will be used with the graphics system have electronic encoders within parts of the camera assembly (in the lens and the moving platform the camera sits on, sometimes called a ""panhead"") that monitor how the camera is used during the game ( ,  ,  ,   and extender).  The encoders transmit that info live 30 or more times per second to the broadcaster's production truck, where it is processed by Sportvision computers (typically one for each camera). A camera with this type of extra hardware is usually called an ""instrumented"" camera. This information helps keep the yellow 1st & ten line in the proper place without being distorted whenever the camera follows the players or the ball.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cb/First-down-line.jpg/250px-First-down-line.jpg|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_%26_Ten_(graphics_system)

en.wikipedia.org,User talk:Nohat: Difference between revisions - Wikipedia,"Re: Talk:List of words of disputed pronunciation
 I don't think I know enough to detect many other problems. I'd just assumed app-ricot was only current in the US (North America?) and so I looked a bit deeper. Just seemed odd on a page that elsewhere took pains to distinguish between  British, Australian and American usage. On TV here it's popular to advertise some products (shampoo, junk food, kids' toys, action movies) with an American voice-over and I particularly recall one for app-ricat shampoo.
 Of course, one dificulty with vowel sounds is that nobody in the UK actually speaks RP anyway.  Along with everyone north of Warwick, I maintain that ""dance"" and ""romance"" rhyme, but that's not how the dictionaries have it - they have ""dance"" with a long a.
 On ""harass"", early stress - HArass - is the only variant in my UK dictionaries and my aged parents' heads. Also, dictionary.cambridge.org gives just that version in ""[UK] Advanced learners"", but both versions in ""American English"". But see my additions to  .

 That was me by the way.
 About ""Washington"" - it doesn't look like its a pronunciation difference to me, just one of accent. Everyone agrees the first sylable is the same as ""wash"", but they say ""wash"" differently. Perhaps a problem with the phonetic descriptions is that they're so exact they include the accent as well as the general pronunciation. Maybe it would be more neutral to say e.g. the debate is whether ""apricot"" shares its first sylable with ""ape"" or ""application"".

 Well you   do good work.  People call me an asshole, but I say what I think. I'm just glad to see talented people at work. I'll be uploading some color-variants tonight. Maybe they will spark some more refinement and ideas. PS- speaking of professionalism-- I'd never used the color overlays before-- took some getting used to. But I see now that raster-layer versions of that file would have been just about   (roughly) ;) -  07:07, 29 Sep 2003 (UTC)
 Could you upload logo variants with the subtitles
 We'll probably need the subtitle in all languages, but these are the most important ones. I've experimented with using  , but this font doesn't really look nice in combination with the logo, and puzzling it together would require changes to the code; I would prefer it to have an individual file for each language.  21:41, Oct 13, 2003 (UTC)

 You got the text wrong on Danish and Polish (at least as per the old logos), see above.  03:08, Oct 14, 2003 (UTC)
 Hi, I have copied this from talk about your logo on Meta in case you haven't noticed it:
 Could you use normal cyrillic I ( И ) instead of short I? It is also unique for Cyrillic but, unlike short I, present in Serbian and Macedonian as well. Or, if you're afraid that some people will think it is N upside down, you could use Zhe ( Ж ); I think it is more often used as a sample Cyrillic letter, it is symetric, and (unlike I) doesn't originate from Greek alphabet (so, it is more Cyrillic, in a way).   11:44, 12 Oct 2003 (UTC)",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Nohat?diff=prev&oldid=1578481

en.wikipedia.org,Wikipedia:Wrapper templates - Wikipedia,"are outer templates which wrap around simpler inner templates, to greatly extend the basic functionality of the inner templates. The concept is to structure the underlying, inner templates to be used as utility tools by various outer, wrapper templates. Templates can be wrapped to existing templates with  .
 Experience has shown that, when the underlying templates have been restructured with a full set of options to be used, then numerous variations of wrapper templates have been created to extend template functionality with a broad variety of new features.
 Wrapper templates can be useful for  , as they allow templates to build off of each other, whereas copying and pasting templates can make them harder to maintain.
 The function of   is to place a box on one's userpage stating that one is taking a wikibreak to focus on exams. A more general template for wikibreaks,  , already exists, so rather than duplicating it, {{ }} just consists of a call of {{ }} with some parameters specified, such as an image of books rather than the default image of a sunset.
  inserts a message on a talk page that one is following the page and doesn't need to be pinged in replies. It calls   with the   parameter specified. This gets a little trickier because {{ }} may be substituted. To address this, the actual code used is  .
 Many templates, such as {{ }} or {{ }}, are just simple wrappers around Lua modules, in this case   and  . This is straightforward to implement as the   table in Lua, which is accessed from the module, can directly read the arguments passed to the wrapper template. The template can then be as simple as   (although there is slightly more code to make it substable and add documentation). Two of the main points of this are to avoid needing the ""{{#invoke:"" syntax in articles, and backward compatibility.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Twemoji_1f527.svg/30px-Twemoji_1f527.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wrapper_templates

en.wikipedia.org,Velvet season - Wikipedia,"(Russian:    :  ) is a term  for early autumn,  one of the most comfortable times of the year for people to vacation in the  , particularly in the   that was known as the ""Russian Riviera"".  During the velvet season, the weather is not as hot as in mid-summer months, but is still quite warm, even at night. In North America, an analogy of ""velvet season"" is the  .
 The term appeared in the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries in   when it was fashionable to vacation in the  . According to Alexander Levintov, at the beginning of the twentieth century ""velvet season"" referred to several weeks in April and May, when the court and the royal family moved from   to the Crimea. Fur clothes were replaced with velvet, as the Crimea at this time was still cool. The summer in the Crimea was called   season and September called plys season. 
 Although its origins relate to the nobility, the velvet season came to have a more general meaning. It is better defined by the general public's tastes, behaviors, and morals than by those of the nobility. By the 1900s, people traveled for the velvet season because it was fashionable and they were hoping to meet people, rather than because the court was traveling. 
 Although it has proven impossible to determine the exact point in time, at some point, the velvet season switched from referring to the spring to the fall, overlapping with the wool/silk seasons in August and September. 
 
The well-known Russian author  , described Velvet season in his 1914 short story "" "" (Винная Бочка): These are golden days for  , and, perhaps, for the entire  . It lasts no more than a month and usually coincides with the   of Lent, Easter and St. Thomas Sunday. Some people come in order to get rid of the sad need to make visits; others — as newlyweds making a wedding trip; and still others — the majority of them — because it is fashionable that at this time everything noble and rich is going to Yalta, that you can flash toilets and beauty, make profitable acquaintances. Of course, no one notices nature. And I must say that it is at this early spring time that Crimea, all in a pink and white frame of blooming apple trees, almonds, pears, peaches and apricots, not yet dusty, not fetid, refreshed by the magical sea air, is truly beautiful.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_season

 Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can.
 who may tell the tale
of the old man?
weigh absence in a scale?
mete want with a span?
the sum assess
of the world's woes?
nothingness
in words enclose?
     - So I repeat we never can have a true view of man unless we have a love for him. Civilisation must be judged and prized, not by the amount of power it has developed, but by how much it has evolved and given expression to, by its laws and institutions, the love of humanity.
     - O my soul, do not aspire to immortal life,
 but exhaust the limits of the possible.
 Come, come, whoever you are,
Wanderer, idolater, worshiper of fire,
Come even though you have broken your vows a thousand times,
Come, and come yet again.
Ours is not a caravan of  despair
 If God be within the mosque, then to whom does this world belong?
If Ram be within the image which you find upon your pilgrimage,
then who is there to know what happens without?
Hari is in the East, Allah is in the West.
Look within your heart, for there you will find both Karim and Ram;

en.wikipedia.org,Wikipedia:Content forks/Internal - Wikipedia,"Discussions   be forked to multiple talk pages, noticeboards, or other venues, but centralized in a single place.  Opening duplicate discussions wastes editorial time, scatters editorial input, and can even lead to conflicting outcomes.  Intentionally forking discussions may be interpreted as   or  .
 It is sometimes useful to relocate a discussion to a more appropriate page; this is usually effectively done by posting a pointer to the new discussion from the old one, though if discussion continues in the original location, it may be appropriate to   it, for example with:
 
[Forked discussion here] 
 When   a discussion to other talk pages, you can help prevent discussion forking at the locations of these notices by prefacing them with  , immediately after the section heading for the notice. It is also helpful to spell out the location of the discussion (e.g.,  ) rather than to effectively hide it with a piped link (e.g.,  ).
 In most cases, an open discussion is preferably kept at the place where it first began, with split-off discussions closed and retargetted to the oldest open discussion. However, in some of the exceptional cases described below it is also possible, depending on circumstances, that both old and new discussion are kept open concurrently, or that the older discussion is closed rather than the newer one. Examples:
 
Some pages are not suitable for discussing behavioral issues (e.g. article talk pages,  ); Other pages are not suitable for discussing the content of a particular mainspace article (e.g. user talk pages,  ). If an issue inappropriate for the present venue turns up in a discussion that by its nature is otherwise in an appropriate place, the new issue can be split off to an appropriate venue.
 If a local   fails to emerge (other than perhaps meta-agreement that no clear consensus on the substance can be expected to emerge from the discussion in that place), the discussion may be brought to an appropriate, broader venue. For example, whether to include information from a given source can, if the discussion remains unresolved, be escalated to  ; or, if the content regards a living person, to  ; etc.
 If a new discussion topic is opened in a venue where it doesn't belong (e.g. an issue regarding the biography of a 19th-century person at  ), the topic may be closed or   to a more appropriate venue.  
 While splitting up user-talk discussions is most often undesirable and potentially confusing or unconducive to resolution of issues, users have broad leeway to reply on their own talk page or that of a particular editor to issues or questions that are sometimes inappropriately raised elsewhere, and may   the other editor(s) to that new thread. ""Take it to user talk"" is a common response to inter-personal conflicts that pop up in article talk pages, for example, where the focus should be on content.  Some users may request that a reply to something they have posted at one talk page be taken to their own (or not taken to their own).  Some may also prefer to move a discussion mostly about another user or topic from their own talk page or even to a noticeboard; or to   the off-topic portion to somewhere else; or to close the original discussion and open a new one at a more appropriate venue.  There are no hard-and-fast rules about such matters.  In general, if an editor expresses such a preference and it is not a big deal to you, just go along with it.  Remember that   is to respect, within reason, the wishes of another editor with regard to the management and use of their own talk page.
 A bit of advice for closers of discussions: It is best to not leave participants in a discussion guessing where to go next after a discussion has been closed – regardless of the nature of the discussion (other than  'ed trolling and the like).  E.g., at   and  , a closing admin imposing a restriction will usually include where and after how much time an imposed sanction can be appealed. Or, the closer of a   that didn't quite come to a consensus will often suggest to give the matter a rest for a few months and then to open a new RM with a narrowed rationale and more data, at the same venue. Or, a   close of an RfC, in which two sides both cite a large number of sources but cannot reach agreement on the sources' reliability, might recommend   for some source examination by uninvolved parties.
 It is   constructive to attempt to create a new page or section of  -style material that   an existing one. This applies to any proposed policy, guideline, supplement, information page,  , help/how-to page, or any other material meant to provide serious advice for editors or to establish rules or best practices.  Even a proposal that is simply redundant will not be accepted, but merged or deleted, as retaining separate pages covering the same issue would inevitably lead to diverging advice and avoidable conflict between editors.  The same concerns apply to modifying an existing page of this sort to conflict with another existing one.  In particular, forking topic-specific guidance to conflict with site-wide norms is  . (If you're certain a general rule needs a special exception, propose that an exception be listed at that rule, rather than fork your own ersatz ""counter-rule"".)
 When   is applied to such material – e.g., with one narrow page summarizing the applicable guidance of another, broader one – the original page or section should be linked to from the summarizing one, and it may be appropriate to use a   template atop the summarizing section to point to the original prominently. This helps people find the controlling material, and helps editors keep the advice and its language compatible across pages.
 If you disagree with the wording or interpretation of any policy material (broadly defined), the appropriate process is to open a discussion on its talk page and seek consensus to change or clarify it.  While an attempt to just   change the content without prior discussion is  , there is a high likelihood that it will be  , because changes to these materials  .
  that serve an   purpose are often forked intentionally and permissibly, to provide differing perspectives.
 However, a few essays, and other types of pages with the authority level of essays (i.e., below policies and guidelines) are   not opinional, and are well-accepted by the community, representing a broad consensus. It is not constructive to do something like draft up your own opposition version that directly contradicts a page like  ,  ,  ,  ,  , or    .  If you disagree with something in a page like this, it is more productive to propose a change to the current version at its talk page.
 Even for opinional essays,   to include your new material (even if it is a counterpoint, in a new section for that).  Wikipedia already has more essays than anyone will ever read. This is both a maintenance problem and a limitation on how much influence your material could have. You will find a bigger and more attentive audience if your work can practicably be integrated (with  ) into an essay that is frequently read than if you create a new page no one knows about or is likely to discover.  However, highly personal ruminations are best as stand-alone pages; avoid changing the overall nature and thrust of an existing community or single-author essay. Such materials generally belong in the    ; especially contrarian or idiosyncratic essays in   namespace are often user-spaced or even removed by  .
 If you do feel your material should be in a separate page, please ensure that it is categorized appropriately in the subcategories of   (if in the ""Wikipedia:"" namespace) or   (if in the ""User:"" namespace), has cross-references to it in the ""See also"" sections of other relevant essays (to avoid the   problem), and see   for some indexes in which to list your essay and a brief description of it.  Unless you expect that people will frequently refer to the essay on talk pages, it is not necessary and is even undesirable to create a   for it; the available intelligible shortcuts are a finite resource.
 .  If you run across some, consider  , or if they are disused and their principal authors are not active,   just   yourself.
 Process-forking (or procedure-forking) is generally a poor idea.    (both as to benefits and costs), so a new process should not be created (especially not an overlapping one) without a community consensus that there's a need for it.  Unnecessary process is  . No one is going to take it seriously if you create a ""WP:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents/Biochemistry"" as a topical alternative to  ; it would be deleted quickly.  Many   have found that after creating an ""/Assessment"" or ""/Peer review"" process subpage that no one ever uses it; try to create sufficient editorial interest in running a   process first, to ensure that it will be practical.  Similarly, it is strongly discouraged to create a new wikiproject or taskforce/workgroup without a consensus at   that it will be useful and will have sufficient participation.
 : Creating a new process page in opposition to an established one will almost certainly be interpreted as  , and get sent to   (MfD).  Wikiprojects are a form, or at least locus, of process. A bogus wikiproject set up as a ""  farm"" – to oppose a consensus, lobby for changes to policy,   article content for a specific viewpoint, or any other activity   and smooth operation, will be deleted   at MfD.
 Some process forks can have   effects – usually a result of   with Wikipedia norms, procedures, and maintenance tools, or an improper understanding of how project organization and management work.  An example is the creation of new (or modification of existing)   classes, which breaks compatibility with various  ,  , and  . A related example is the forking of general wikiprojects into increasingly narrow sub-topical ones (especially without a successful  ); this simultaneously drains editorial activity from the viable, broader wikiprojects, and sets up too-narrow ""micro-projects"" which become moribund within a year or less due to too few participants.  Another type of case is the creation of a wanna-be   on a topical basis; it is not within a wikiproject's scope or authority to set up a   of a dispute resolution and sanctions venue to enforce its viewpoint on content matters.  Yet another example is the creation of a bogus pseudo-process inside a wikiproject to change   to suit the preferences of the project participants, and bypass established   process; one project trying this caused a tremendous amount of disruption over several years until a   and an   reversed them.
 Remember that   – including about how Wikipedia operates – absent a   that the community accepts.
 Some process forking has been organic, with different – even confusingly dissimilar – procedures evolving over time for rather parallel processes. These have polar tendencies to either slowly normalize towards each other,   to become ingrained and ossified. The former is preferable since it reduces the   of   that Wikipedians are expected to learn and comply with.
 Wikipedia has thousands of   (what in most other contexts would be called  ) that produce reader- and editor-visible, pre-formatted output. Many of these form consistent series that are explicitly intended to produce similar and compatible results.  While there is some room for variation (e.g., many   and   subtly use color associated with the topic, such as a sports team), ""output forking"" the results of one of a set of templates to clash with the rest of them is not constructive.
 Just directly forking the code of a template is often ill-advised.  New templates that substantially duplicate the behavior of old ones with a minor variation are usually   and   by   (TfD) back into the parent template, either as an undesired variant, or as an output option simply toggled with an additional template parameter.  Templates that output something radically different from Wikipedia's normal style or expected needs are usually simply deleted outright. Unnecessary templates have considerable editorial maintenance costs, so TfD is a busy place. See also  , especially the sections on it not being a Web host, a social-networking site, a publisher of original ideas, a forum, or a soapbox for promotion.  A large number of inappropriate template and output forks are attempts to impose a personal ""design vision"" on something, to add features that don't belong in an encyclopedia, or to visually emphasize something in an   way. (If such a template has legitimate uses in the ""User:"" or ""Wikipedia:"" namespaces, it might be retained but re-coded to not produce such output in mainspace articles.)
 If   has been achieved for a template to format something a particular way (e.g for   reasons), or to not include some information deemed inappropriate, it is generally not okay to fork your own copy that does it the way you wish consensus had settled on.
 Finally, when two templates are very similar (or an old-style template and a newer   are, and the template does not already rely on the module), and they are kept un-merged for a reason, it is not helpful to fork their options – especially what parameters are supported and what their names are – without a very good reason to do so.  It makes using our templates much more difficult for everyone when related ones are not in-sync.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1d/Information_icon4.svg/40px-Information_icon4.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Walnut.png/30px-Walnut.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Content_forking/Internal

en.wikipedia.org,Wikipedia:Redundancy is good - Wikipedia,"When it comes to the behind-the-scenes administration of Wikipedia,  . Just as   arrays and similar redundant systems exist in the computer field to allow for the possibility of a hardware failure, so should the same principle apply to Wikipedia when it comes to editors. In the Wikipedia system, having multiple editors that perform the same task is useful because it allows for the possibility that one or more editors leave the project, temporarily or otherwise.
 Why do we have 859   and 15  ? Just in case some of them are temporarily indisposed. Redundancy allows systems to operate more efficiently by allowing for unforeseen circumstances. Computer hardware is not immune to failure, and neither is Wikipedia.
 Logically, we can condense this to the following principle: redundancy should be sought in any situation where there are few negatives to having it. Systems whose value becomes that of the weakest usable component would not qualify as such as situation, just as some computer parallel memory arrays are limited by the speeds of lower-powered chips, or when many chefs attempt to prepare the proverbial broth. Wikipedia editors generally work as independent actors or on an ad hoc group basis, so in general, redundancy is good.
 This may discount the reasoning ""we have enough   (admins, bureaucrats, mediators...); more   are not needed.""  It does not necessarily discount the reasoning ""we have plenty of  , so we can afford to be selective"", when combined with a reason not to promote.
 Redundancy engenders  , and aggregation is one of the main principles on which   and other collaborative projects such as Wikipedia are based. Aggregation permits to build on the efforts of others by tapping into the wisdom of the   rather than the wisdom of the few.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Essay.svg/30px-Essay.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Redundancy_is_good

en.wikipedia.org,Wikipedia:Too long; didn't read - Wikipedia,"(abbreviated   and  ) is a shorthand to indicate that a passage is too long to invest the time to digest it.  Akin to  .
 The label is often used to point out excessive verbosity or to signify the presence of and location of a short summary in case the page is too long and won't otherwise be read.  It can be misused as a tactic to thwart collaborative editing or a  . If a discussion is reasonably concise, it is best practice to  .
 Many people edit Wikipedia because they enjoy writing; however, that passion can result in overlong  . This reflects a lack of time or commitment to refine an effort through successively more concise  . With some application, natural redundancies and digressions can often be eliminated. Recall the venerable paraphrase of  : ""I made this so long because I did not have time to make it shorter."" 
 Also writers can incorrectly believe that long sentences and big words make that writer appear learned.  Some inexperienced contributors over-avoid   by using more words (see  / ). Even capable authors recognize the risk of distortion through brevity. 
 Some policies and procedures can encourage overlong prose due to imposing arbitrary limits. The   process requires established articles to have a fivefold expansion of prose within a seven-day window to be considered for listing on the main page. This can encourage over-verbose writing to  .
 A trusted   states that ""brevity is the soul of wit.""  Similarly, ""omit needless words.""  Editors are encouraged to write concisely and to use plain vocabulary when possible. Remember that English may not be a reader's native tongue. If length is essential, a short summary is advised.
 While bloated composition may reflect the emotions of an editor, it should be noted that some people are constitutionally  . It is impossible for you, as an editor, to affect either of these before the fact. When editing, always respect Wikipedia policies and editors' feelings. Take the time to distill your thoughts for better communication and rapport.
 Internal policy discussions on talk pages can often become long-winded, too, usually for two reasons: because of the detailed nature of   (and their often complicated interaction with each other), and because curt and questionable assertions of policy rationales (especially when many are made in series in a single post) may require a fairly detailed response. The cure for this problem is to make a clear, policy-related statement to begin with, and avoid citing more policy and guideline pages than are necessary to get the point across (many say the same thing in slightly different wording). If you cite five such pages in vague terms for the same point, you open the door to   about wording and interpretation – you may get five paragraphs of rebuttal in response instead of one sentence of agreement.
 Per the  , text in Wikipedia should be written succinctly; or, existing texts should be trimmed if it contains  . The article should be   into another article when appropriate.   Be clear before excising copy that it can't be refined and kept. Tagging bloated plot summaries at movie, book, and play pages with the {{ }} template is not as good as winnowing them yourself.
 Some linguists (such as   in posts at  ) criticize  's advice ""omit needless words"" in the fear that unskilled editors may mistake even necessary length for dross and delete it. Strunk and White, however, were unambiguous that   does not require ""the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell."" Deleting is not always equivalent to improving, and intelligently differentiating the cases deserves care.
 Being too quick to   may come across as dismissive and rude. Preferably, create a section on their   and politely offer advice there.
 Avoid  . Substituting a flippant ""tl;dr"" for reasoned response and cordiality   and amounts to  . Just as one cannot  , neither can one prove by wielding a four letter initialism. When illumination, patience, and wisdom are called for, answer with them.
 A further option for both readers and writers is to structure the writing so it can be   effectively. This means writing the   as a summary of the paragraph, so the reader can quickly know which paragraphs or sections are of interest to read for more detail, in addition to the usual practice of putting a summary at the beginning of articles or sections.  This works even when the content is concise, or for some uses should be complete, but a reader wishes to skim for speed in a disciplined and more accurate way.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Essay.svg/30px-Essay.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Walnut.png/30px-Walnut.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/44px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg/40px-Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long,_didn%27t_read"

en.wikipedia.org,Hamlet - Wikipedia,", often shortened to   ( ), is a   written by   sometime between 1599 and 1601. It is Shakespeare's longest play. Set in  , the   depicts   and his attempts to exact revenge against his uncle,  , who has murdered   in order to seize his throne and marry  .   is considered among the ""most powerful and influential tragedies in the English language"", with a story capable of ""seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others"".  It is widely considered one of the greatest plays of all time.  Three different early versions of the play are extant: the   (Q1, 1603); the Second   (Q2, 1604); and the   (F1, 1623). Each version includes lines and passages missing from the others.  
 Many works have been pointed to as possible sources for Shakespeare's play, from ancient   to  . The editors of the Arden Shakespeare question the idea of ""source hunting"", pointing out that it presupposes that authors always require ideas from other works for their own, and suggests that no author can have an original idea or be an originator. When Shakespeare wrote, there were many stories about sons avenging the murder of their fathers, and many about clever avenging sons pretending to be foolish in order to outsmart their foes. This would include the story of the ancient Roman,  , which Shakespeare apparently knew, as well as the story of  , which was preserved in Latin by 13th-century chronicler   in his  , and printed in Paris in 1514. The Amleth story was subsequently adapted and then published in French in 1570 by the 16th-century scholar  . It has a number of plot elements and major characters in common with Shakespeare's  , and lacks others that are found in Shakespeare. Belleforest's story was first published in English in 1608, after   had been written, though it's possible that Shakespeare had encountered it in the French-language version. 
  of Denmark is the son of the recently deceased  , and nephew of  , his father's brother and successor. Claudius hastily married King Hamlet's widow, Gertrude, Hamlet's mother, and took the throne for himself. Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighbouring  , in which King Hamlet slew King Fortinbras of Norway in a battle some years ago. Although Denmark defeated Norway and the Norwegian throne fell to King Fortinbras's infirm brother, Denmark fears that an invasion led by the dead Norwegian king's son, Prince  , is imminent.
 On a cold night on the ramparts of  , the Danish royal castle, the   Bernardo and Marcellus discuss a   resembling the late King Hamlet which they have recently seen, and bring Prince Hamlet's friend   as a witness. After the ghost appears again, the three vow to tell Prince Hamlet what they have witnessed.
 The court gathers the next day, and King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss affairs of state with their elderly adviser  . Claudius grants permission for Polonius's son Laertes to return to school in France, and he sends envoys to inform the King of Norway about Fortinbras. Claudius also questions Hamlet regarding his continuing to grieve for his father, and forbids him to return to his university in  . After the court exits, Hamlet despairs of his father's death and his mother's hasty remarriage. Learning of the ghost from Horatio, Hamlet resolves to see it himself.
 As Polonius's son Laertes prepares to depart for France, Polonius offers him advice that culminates in the maxim ""to thine own self be true.""  Polonius's daughter,  , admits her interest in Hamlet, but Laertes warns her against seeking the prince's attention, and Polonius orders her to reject his advances. That night on the rampart, the ghost appears to Hamlet, tells the prince that he was   by Claudius, and demands that Hamlet avenge the murder. Hamlet agrees, and the ghost vanishes. The prince confides to Horatio and the sentries that from now on he plans to ""put an antic disposition on"", or act as though he has gone mad. Hamlet forces them to swear to keep his plans for revenge secret; however, he remains uncertain of the ghost's reliability.
 Ophelia rushes to her father, telling him that Hamlet arrived at her door the prior night half-undressed and behaving erratically. Polonius blames love for Hamlet's madness and resolves to inform Claudius and Gertrude. As he enters to do so, the king and queen are welcoming  , two student acquaintances of Hamlet, to Elsinore. The royal couple has requested that the two students investigate the cause of Hamlet's mood and behaviour. Additional news requires that Polonius wait to be heard: messengers from Norway inform Claudius that the king of Norway has rebuked Prince Fortinbras for attempting to re-fight his father's battles. The forces that Fortinbras had conscripted to march against Denmark will instead be sent against  , though they will pass through Danish territory to get there.
 Polonius tells Claudius and Gertrude his theory regarding Hamlet's behaviour, and then speaks to Hamlet in a hall of the castle to try to learn more. Hamlet feigns madness and subtly insults Polonius all the while. When Rosencrantz and Guildenstern arrive, Hamlet greets his ""friends"" warmly but quickly discerns that they are there to spy on him for Claudius. Hamlet admits that he is upset at his situation but refuses to give the true reason, instead remarking "" "". Rosencrantz and Guildenstern tell Hamlet that they have brought along a troupe of actors that they met while travelling to Elsinore. Hamlet, after welcoming the actors and dismissing his friends-turned-spies, asks them to deliver a soliloquy about the death of   and   at the climax of the  . Hamlet then asks the actors to stage  , a play featuring a death in the style of his father's murder. Hamlet intends to study Claudius's reaction to the play, and thereby determine the truth of the ghost's story of Claudius's guilt.
 Polonius forces Ophelia to return Hamlet's love letters to the prince while he and Claudius secretly watch in order to evaluate Hamlet's reaction. Hamlet is walking alone in the hall as the King and Polonius await Ophelia's entrance. Hamlet muses on thoughts of  . When Ophelia enters and tries to return Hamlet's things, Hamlet accuses her of immodesty and cries ""get thee to a nunnery"", though it is unclear whether this, too, is a show of madness or genuine distress. His reaction convinces Claudius that Hamlet is not mad for love. Shortly thereafter, the court assembles to watch the play Hamlet has commissioned. After seeing the   murdered by his rival pouring poison in his ear, Claudius abruptly rises and runs from the room; for Hamlet, this is proof of his uncle's guilt.
 Gertrude summons Hamlet to her chamber to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has possession of his ill-gotten goods: his brother's crown and wife. He sinks to his knees. Hamlet, on his way to visit his mother, sneaks up behind him but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while his father's ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen's bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a  , calls for help as Gertrude, believing Hamlet wants to kill her, calls out for help herself.
 Hamlet, believing it is Claudius, stabs wildly, killing Polonius, but he pulls aside the curtain and sees his mistake. In a rage, Hamlet brutally insults his mother for her apparent ignorance of Claudius's villainy, but the ghost enters and reprimands Hamlet for his inaction and harsh words. Unable to see or hear the ghost herself, Gertrude takes Hamlet's conversation with it as further evidence of madness. After begging the queen to stop sleeping with Claudius, Hamlet leaves, dragging Polonius's corpse away.
 Hamlet jokes with Claudius about where he has hidden Polonius's body, and the king, fearing for his life, sends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to accompany Hamlet to England with a sealed letter to the English king requesting that Hamlet be executed immediately.
 Unhinged by grief at Polonius's death, Ophelia wanders Elsinore. Laertes arrives back from France, enraged by his father's death and his sister's madness. Claudius convinces Laertes that Hamlet is solely responsible, but a letter soon arrives indicating that Hamlet has returned to Denmark, foiling Claudius's plan. Claudius switches tactics, proposing a fencing match between Laertes and Hamlet to settle their differences. Laertes will be given a poison-tipped foil, and, if that fails, Claudius will offer Hamlet poisoned wine as a congratulation. Gertrude interrupts to report that Ophelia has drowned, though it is unclear whether it was suicide or an accident caused by her madness.
 Horatio has received a letter from Hamlet, explaining that the prince escaped by negotiating with pirates who attempted to attack his England-bound ship, and the friends reunite offstage. Two   discuss Ophelia's apparent suicide while digging her grave. Hamlet arrives with Horatio and banters with one of the gravediggers, who unearths the skull of a   from Hamlet's childhood,  . Hamlet picks up the skull, saying ""Alas, poor Yorick"" as he contemplates mortality. Ophelia's   approaches, led by Laertes. Hamlet and Horatio initially hide, but when Hamlet realizes that Ophelia is the one being buried, he reveals himself, proclaiming his love for her. Laertes and Hamlet fight by Ophelia's graveside, but the brawl is broken up.
 Back at Elsinore, Hamlet explains to Horatio that he had discovered Claudius's letter among Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's belongings and replaced it with a forged copy indicating that his former friends should be killed instead. A foppish courtier,  , interrupts the conversation to deliver the fencing challenge to Hamlet. Hamlet, despite Horatio's pleas, accepts it. Hamlet does well at first, leading the match by two hits to none, and Gertrude raises a toast to him using the poisoned glass of wine Claudius had set aside for Hamlet. Claudius tries to stop her but is too late: she drinks, and Laertes realizes the plot will be revealed. Laertes slashes Hamlet with his poisoned blade. In the ensuing scuffle, they switch weapons, and Hamlet wounds Laertes with his own poisoned sword. Gertrude collapses and, claiming she has been poisoned, dies. In his dying moments, Laertes reconciles with Hamlet and reveals Claudius's plan. Hamlet rushes at Claudius and kills him. As the poison takes effect, Hamlet, hearing that Fortinbras is marching through the area, names the Norwegian prince as his successor. Horatio, distraught at the thought of being the last survivor and living whilst Hamlet does not, says he will commit suicide by drinking the dregs of Gertrude's poisoned wine, but Hamlet begs him to live on and tell his story. Hamlet dies in Horatio's arms, proclaiming ""the rest is silence"". Fortinbras, who was ostensibly marching towards Poland with his army, arrives at the palace, along with an English ambassador bringing news of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's deaths. Horatio promises to recount the full story of what happened, and Fortinbras, seeing the entire Danish royal family dead, takes the crown for himself and orders a military funeral to honour Hamlet.
 -like legends are so widely found (for example in Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, Byzantium, and Arabia) that the core ""hero-as-fool"" theme is possibly   in origin.  Several ancient written precursors to   can be identified. The first is the anonymous Scandinavian  . In this, the murdered king has two sons—  and  —who spend most of the story in disguise, under false names, rather than feigning madness, in a sequence of events that differs from Shakespeare's.  The second is the Roman legend of  , recorded in two separate Latin works. Its hero, Lucius (""shining, light""), changes his name and persona to Brutus (""dull, stupid""), playing the role of a fool to avoid the fate of his father and brothers, and eventually slaying his family's killer,  . A 17th-century Nordic scholar,  , compared the Icelandic hero   (Amlodi) and the hero Prince Ambales (from the  ) to Shakespeare's  . Similarities include the prince's feigned madness, his accidental killing of the king's counsellor in his mother's bedroom, and the eventual slaying of his uncle. 
 Many of the earlier legendary elements are interwoven in the 13th-century ""Life of Amleth"" (Latin:  ) by  , part of  .  Written in Latin, it reflects classical Roman concepts of virtue and heroism, and was widely available in Shakespeare's day.  Significant parallels include the prince feigning madness, his mother's hasty marriage to the usurper, the prince killing a hidden spy, and the prince substituting the execution of two retainers for his own. A reasonably faithful version of Saxo's story was translated into French in 1570 by  , in his  .  Belleforest embellished Saxo's text substantially, almost doubling its length, and introduced the hero's  . 
 According to one theory, Shakespeare's main source may be an earlier play—now lost—known today as the  . Possibly written by   or by Shakespeare, the   would have existed by 1589, and would have incorporated a ghost.  Shakespeare's company,  , may have purchased that play and performed a version for some time, which Shakespeare reworked.  However, no copy of the   has survived, and it is impossible to compare its language and style with the known works of any of its putative authors. In 1936   suggested that, until more becomes known, it may be assumed that Shakespeare wrote the  .    lists reasons for supporting Shakespeare’s authorship.    considers that there are no grounds for thinking that the   is an early work by Shakespeare, which he then rewrote.  Professor Terri Bourus in 2016, one of three general editors of the New Oxford Shakespeare,  in her paper ""Enter Shakespeare's Young Hamlet, 1589"" suggests that Shakespeare was ""interested in sixteenth-century French literature, from the very beginning of his career"" and therefore ""did not need Thomas Kyd to pre-digest Belleforest's histoire of Amleth and spoon-feed it to him"". She considers that the hypothesized   is Shakespeare's Q1 text, and that this derived directly from Belleforest's French version. 
 The precise combination of Shakespeare's use of the  , Belleforest, Saxo, or Kyd's   as sources for   is not known. However, elements of Belleforest's version which are not in Saxo's story do appear in Shakespeare's play. 
 Most scholars reject the idea that   is in any way connected with Shakespeare's only son,  , who died in 1596 at age eleven. Conventional wisdom holds that   is too obviously connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time.  However,   has argued that the   of the names and Shakespeare's grief for the loss of his son may lie at the heart of the tragedy. He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler, the Stratford neighbour after whom Hamnet was named, was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that, in the loose orthography of the time, the names were virtually interchangeable. 
 Scholars have often speculated that  s   might have been inspired by   (Lord Burghley)—Lord High Treasurer and chief counsellor to Queen  .   suggested Polonius's advice to Laertes may have echoed Burghley's to his son  .    thought it almost certain that the figure of Polonius caricatured Burghley.    speculated that Polonius's tedious verbosity might have resembled Burghley's.  Lilian Winstanley thought the name Corambis (in the First Quarto) did suggest Cecil and Burghley.    considers the idea of Polonius as a caricature of Burghley to be conjecture, perhaps based on the similar role they each played at court, and perhaps also based on the similarity between Burghley addressing his   to his son, and Polonius offering ""precepts"" to his son, Laertes.  Jenkins suggests that any personal satire may be found in the name ""Polonius"", which might point to a Polish or Polonian connection.  G. R. Hibbard hypothesised that differences in names (Corambis/Polonius:Montano/Raynoldo) between the First Quarto and other editions might reflect a desire not to offend scholars at  . ( , was the founder of Oxford University, and  , was the President of  .) 
 ""Any dating of   must be tentative"", states the   editor,  . MacCary suggests 1599 or 1600;  James Shapiro offers late 1600 or early 1601;    and   suggest that the play was written in 1600 and revised later;  the New Cambridge editor settles on mid-1601;  the New Swan Shakespeare Advanced Series editor agrees with 1601;  Thompson and Taylor, tentatively (""according to whether one is the more persuaded by Jenkins or by Honigmann"") suggest a   of either Spring 1601 or sometime in 1600. 
 The   relies on  s frequent allusions to Shakespeare's  , itself dated to mid-1599.  The   is based on an entry, of 26 July 1602, in the   of the  , indicating that   was ""latelie Acted by the  "".
 In 1598,   published his  , a survey of English literature from Chaucer to its present day, within which twelve of Shakespeare's plays are named.   is not among them, suggesting that it had not yet been written. As   was very popular, Bernard Lott, the series editor of  , believes it ""unlikely that he [Meres] would have overlooked ... so significant a piece"". 
 The phrase ""little eyases""  in the   (F1) may allude to the  , whose popularity in London forced the Globe company into provincial touring.  This became known as the  , and supports a 1601 dating.    accepts a 1600–01 attribution for the date   was written, but notes that the  , playing   in the 3000-capacity  , were unlikely to be put to any disadvantage by an audience of ""barely one hundred"" for the Children of the Chapel's equivalent play,  ; she believes that Shakespeare, confident in the superiority of his own work, was making a playful and charitable allusion to his friend   very similar piece. 
 A contemporary of Shakespeare's,  , wrote a marginal note in his copy of the 1598 edition of   works, which some scholars use as dating evidence. Harvey's note says that ""the wiser sort"" enjoy  , and implies that  —executed in February 1601 for rebellion—was still alive. Other scholars consider this inconclusive. Edwards, for example, concludes that the ""sense of time is so confused in Harvey's note that it is really of little use in trying to date  "". This is because the same note also refers to   and   as if they were still alive (""our flourishing  ""), but also mentions ""  new epigrams"", published in 1607. 
 Three early editions of the text, each different, have survived, making attempts to establish a single ""authentic"" text problematic. 
 This list does not include three additional early texts,  's Q3, Q4, and Q5 (1611–37), which are regarded as reprints of Q2 with some alterations. 
 Early  , beginning with   (1709) and   (1733), combined material from the two earliest sources of   available at the time, Q2 and F1. Each text contains material that the other lacks, with many minor differences in wording: scarcely 200 lines are identical in the two. Editors have combined them in an effort to create one ""inclusive"" text that reflects an imagined ""ideal"" of Shakespeare's original. Theobald's version became standard for a long time,  and his ""full text"" approach continues to influence editorial practice to the present day. Some contemporary scholarship, however, discounts this approach, instead considering ""an authentic   an unrealisable ideal. ... there are   of this play but no  "".  The 2006 publication by Arden Shakespeare of different   texts in different volumes is perhaps evidence of this shifting focus and emphasis.  Other editors have continued to argue the need for well-edited editions taking material from all versions of the play. Colin Burrow has argued that ""most of us should read a text that is made up by conflating all three versions ... it's about as likely that Shakespeare wrote: ""To be or not to be, ay, there's the point"" [in Q1], as that he wrote the works of  . I suspect most people just won't want to read a three-text play ... [multi-text editions are] a version of the play that is out of touch with the needs of a wider public."" 
 Traditionally, editors of Shakespeare's plays have divided them into five acts. None of the early texts of  , however, were arranged this way, and the play's division into acts and scenes derives from a 1676 quarto. Modern editors generally follow this traditional division but consider it unsatisfactory; for example, after Hamlet drags Polonius's body out of Gertrude's bedchamber, there is an act-break  after which the action appears to continue uninterrupted. 
 Q1 was discovered in 1823. Only two copies are extant. According to Jenkins, ""The unauthorized nature of this quarto is matched by the corruption of its text.""  Yet Q1 has value: it contains stage directions (such as Ophelia entering with a lute and her hair down) that reveal actual stage practices in a way that Q2 and F1 do not; it contains an entire scene (usually labelled 4.6)  that does not appear in either Q2 or F1; and it is useful for comparison with the later editions. The major deficiency of Q1 is in the language: particularly noticeable in the opening lines of the famous "" "" soliloquy: ""To be, or not to be, aye there's the point. / To die, to sleep, is that all? Aye all: / No, to sleep, to dream, aye marry there it goes."" However, the scene order is more coherent, without the problems of Q2 and F1 of Hamlet seeming to resolve something in one scene and enter the next drowning in indecision. New Cambridge editor Kathleen Irace has noted that ""Q1's more linear plot design is certainly easier [...] to follow [...] but the simplicity of the Q1 plot arrangement eliminates the alternating plot elements that correspond to Hamlet's shifts in mood."" 
 Q1 is considerably shorter than Q2 or F1 and may be a   of the play as Shakespeare's company performed it, by an actor who played a minor role (most likely Marcellus).  Scholars disagree whether the reconstruction was pirated or authorised. It is suggested by Irace that Q1 is an abridged version intended especially for travelling productions, thus the question of length may be considered as separate from issues of poor textual quality.  Editing Q1 thus poses problems in whether or not to ""correct"" differences from Q2 and F. Irace, in her introduction to Q1, wrote that ""I have avoided as many other alterations as possible, because the differences...are especially intriguing...I have recorded a selection of Q2/F readings in the collation."" The idea that Q1 is not riddled with error but is instead eminently fit for the stage has led to at least 28 different Q1 productions since 1881.  Other productions have used the probably superior Q2 and Folio texts, but used Q1's running order, in particular moving the   soliloquy earlier.  Developing this, some editors such as   have argued that Q2 may represent ""a 'reading' text as opposed to a 'performance' one"" of  , analogous to how modern films released on disc may include deleted scenes: an edition containing all of Shakespeare's material for the play for the pleasure of readers, so not representing the play as it would have been staged. 
 From the early 17th century, the play was famous for its ghost and vivid dramatisation of   and  , leading to a procession of mad courtiers and ladies in   and   drama.  Though it remained popular with mass audiences, late 17th-century   critics saw   as primitive and disapproved of its lack of   and  .  This view changed drastically in the 18th century, when critics regarded Hamlet as a hero—a pure, brilliant young man thrust into unfortunate circumstances.  
 By the mid-18th century, however, the advent of   brought   and   readings, returning madness and the ghost to the forefront.  Not until the late 18th century did critics and performers begin to view Hamlet as confusing and inconsistent. Before then, he was either mad, or not; either a hero, or not; with no in-betweens.  These developments represented a fundamental change in literary criticism, which came to focus more on character and less on plot.   In the 18th century, one negative French review of Hamlet would be widely discussed for centuries, in particular in publications throughout the 19th and 20th century.               In 1768,   wrote a negative review of  , stating that ""it is vulgar and barbarous drama, which would not be tolerated by the vilest populace of France or Italy... one would imagine this piece to be a work of a drunken savage"". 
 By the 19th century,   critics valued   for its internal, individual conflict reflecting the strong contemporary emphasis on internal struggles and inner character in general.  Then too, critics started to focus on Hamlet's delay as a character trait, rather than a plot device.  This focus on character and internal struggle continued into the 20th century, when criticism branched in several directions, discussed in   below.
 Modern editors have divided the play into five acts, and each act into scenes. The First Folio marks the first two acts only. The quartos do not have such divisions. The division into five acts follows  , who in his plays, regularized the way ancient Greek tragedies contain five episodes, which are separated by four choral odes. In   the development of the plot or the action are determined by the unfolding of Hamlet's character. The soliloquies do not interrupt the plot, instead they are highlights of each block of action. The plot is the developing revelation of Hamlet's view of what is ""rotten in the state of Denmark."" The action of the play is driven forward in dialogue; but in the soliloquies time and action stop, the meaning of action is questioned, fog of illusion is broached, and truths are exposed.
 The contrast between appearance and reality is a significant theme. Hamlet is presented with an image, and then interprets its deeper or darker meaning. Examples begin with Hamlet questioning the reality of the ghost. It continues with Hamlet's taking on an ""antic disposition"" in order to appear mad, though he is not. The contrast (appearance and reality) is also expressed in several ""spying scenes"": Act two begins with Polonius sending Reynaldo to spy on his son, Laertes. Claudius and Polonius spy on Ophelia as she meets with Hamlet. In act two, Claudius asks Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to spy on Hamlet. Similarly, the play-within-a-play is used by Hamlet to reveal his step-father's hidden nature.
 There is no subplot, but the play presents the affairs of the courtier Polonius, his daughter, Ophelia, and his son, Laertes—who variously deal with madness, love and the death of a father in ways that contrast with Hamlet's. The graveyard scene eases tension prior to the catastrophe, and, as Hamlet holds the skull, it is shown that Hamlet no longer fears damnation in the afterlife, and accepts that there is a ""divinity that shapes our ends"". 
 Hamlet's enquiring mind has been open to all kinds of ideas, but in act five he has decided on a plan, and in a dialogue with Horatio he seems to answer his two earlier soliloquies on suicide: ""We defy augury. There is special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all. Since no man, of aught he leaves, knows aught, what is't to leave betimes."" 
 The First Quarto (1603) text of   contains 15,983 words, the Second Quarto (1604) contains 28,628 words, and the First Folio (1623) contains 27,602 words. Counting the number of lines varies between editions, partly because prose sections in the play may be formatted with varied lengths.  Editions of   that are created by conflating the texts of the Second Quarto and the Folio are said to have approximately 3,900 lines;  the number of lines varies between those editions based on formatting the prose sections, counting methods, and how the editors have joined the texts together.    is by far the longest play that Shakespeare wrote, and one of the longest plays in the  . It might require more than four hours to stage;  a typical Elizabethan play would need two to three hours.  It is speculated that the because of the considerable length of Q2 and F1, there was an expectation that those texts would be abridged for performance, or that Q2 and F1 may have been aimed at a reading audience. 
 That Q1 is so much shorter than Q2 has spurred speculation that Q1 is an early draft, or perhaps an adaptation, a bootleg copy, or a stage adaptation. On the title page of Q2, its text is described as ""newly imprinted and enlarged to almost as much again as it was."" That is probably a comparison to Q1. 
 Much of  s language is courtly: elaborate, witty discourse, as recommended by  's 1528 etiquette guide,  . This work specifically advises royal retainers to amuse their masters with inventive language. Osric and Polonius, especially, seem to respect this injunction. Claudius's speech is rich with rhetorical figures—as is Hamlet's and, at times, Ophelia's—while the language of Horatio, the guards, and the gravediggers is simpler. Claudius's high status is reinforced by using the   (""we"" or ""us""), and   mixed with   to resonate with Greek political speeches. 
 Of all the characters, Hamlet has the greatest rhetorical skill. He uses highly developed metaphors,  , and in nine memorable words deploys both anaphora and  : ""to die: to sleep— / To sleep, perchance to dream"".  In contrast, when occasion demands, he is precise and straightforward, as when he explains his inward emotion to his mother: ""But I have that within which passes show, / These but the trappings and the suits of woe"".  At times, he relies heavily on   to express his true thoughts while simultaneously concealing them.  Pauline Kiernan argues that Shakespeare changed English drama forever in   because he ""showed how a character's language can often be saying several things at once, and contradictory meanings at that, to reflect fragmented thoughts and disturbed feelings"". She gives the example of Hamlet's advice to Ophelia, ""get thee to a nunnery"",  which, she claims, is simultaneously a reference to a place of chastity and a slang term for a brothel, reflecting Hamlet's confused feelings about female sexuality.  However Harold Jenkins does not agree, having studied the few examples that are used to support that idea, and finds that there is no support for the assumption that ""nunnery"" was used that way in slang, or that Hamlet intended such a meaning. The context of the scene suggests that a nunnery would not be a brothel, but instead a place of renunciation and a ""sanctuary from marriage and from the world’s contamination"".  Thompson and Taylor consider the brothel idea incorrect considering that ""Hamlet is trying to deter Ophelia from  "". 
 Hamlet’s first words in the play are a pun; when Claudius addresses him as ""my cousin Hamlet, and my son"", Hamlet says as an aside: ""A little more than kin, and less than kind."" 
 An unusual rhetorical device,  , appears in several places in the play. Examples are found in Ophelia's speech at the end of the nunnery scene: ""Th'  of the fair state""  and ""And I, of ladies most  "".  Many scholars have found it odd that Shakespeare would, seemingly arbitrarily, use this rhetorical form throughout the play. One explanation may be that   was written later in Shakespeare's life, when he was adept at matching rhetorical devices to characters and the plot. Linguist George T. Wright suggests that hendiadys had been used deliberately to heighten the play's sense of duality and dislocation. 
 Hamlet's   have also captured the attention of scholars. Hamlet interrupts himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly and instead blunts the thrust of his thought with wordplay. It is not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, that Hamlet is able to articulate his feelings freely. 
 Written at a time of religious upheaval and in the wake of the  , the play is alternately   (or piously medieval) and   (or consciously modern). The ghost describes himself as being in   and as dying without  . This and Ophelia's burial ceremony, which is characteristically Catholic, make up most of the play's Catholic connections. Some scholars have observed that   come from Catholic countries such as Italy and Spain, where the revenge tragedies present contradictions of motives, since according to Catholic doctrine the duty to God and family precedes civil justice. Hamlet's conundrum then is whether to avenge his father and kill Claudius or to leave the vengeance to God, as his religion requires. 
 Much of the play's Protestant tones derive from its setting in Denmark—both then and now a predominantly Protestant country,  though it is unclear whether the fictional Denmark of the play is intended to portray this implicit fact. Dialogue refers explicitly to the German city of   where Hamlet, Horatio, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern attend university, implying where the Protestant     nailed the   to the church door in 1517. 
 Hamlet is often perceived as a philosophical character, expounding ideas that are now described as  ,  , and  . For example, he expresses a subjectivistic idea when he says to Rosencrantz: ""there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so"".   The idea that nothing is real except in the mind of the individual finds its roots in the Greek  , who argued that since nothing can be perceived except through the senses—and since all individuals sense, and therefore perceive things differently—there is no absolute truth, but rather only relative truth.  The clearest alleged instance of existentialism is in the "" ""  speech, where Hamlet is thought by some to use ""being"" to allude to life and action, and ""not being"" to death and inaction.
  reflects the contemporary   promoted by the French    .  Prior to Montaigne's time, humanists such as   had argued that man was God's greatest creation, made in God's image and able to choose his own nature, but this view was subsequently challenged in Montaigne's   of 1580. Hamlet's "" "" seems to echo many of Montaigne's ideas, and many scholars have discussed whether Shakespeare drew directly from Montaigne or whether both men were simply reacting similarly to the spirit of the times. 
 ’s thoughts regarding   were first published in his book   (1899), as a footnote to a discussion of  ’ tragedy,   all of which is part of his consideration of the causes of neurosis. Freud does not offer over-all interpretations of the plays, but uses the two tragedies to illustrate and corroborate his psychological theories, which are based on his treatments of his patients and on his studies. Productions of   have used Freud's ideas to support their own interpretations.  In  , Freud says that according to his experience ""parents play a leading part in the infantile psychology of all persons who subsequently become psychoneurotics,"" and that ""falling in love with one parent and hating the other"" is a common impulse in early childhood, and is important source material of ""subsequent neurosis"". He says that ""in their amorous or hostile attitude toward their parents"" neurotics reveal something that occurs with less intensity ""in the minds of the majority of children"". Freud considered that Sophocles’ tragedy,  , with its story that involves crimes of parricide and incest, ""has furnished us with legendary matter which corroborates"" these ideas, and that the ""profound and universal validity of the old legends"" is understandable only by recognizing the validity of these theories of ""infantile psychology"". 
 Freud explores the reason ""  is capable of moving a modern reader or playgoer no less powerfully than it moved the contemporary Greeks"". He suggests that ""It may be that we were all destined to direct our first sexual impulses toward our mothers, and our first impulses of hatred and violence toward our fathers."" Freud suggests that we ""recoil from the person for whom this primitive wish of our childhood has been fulfilled with all the force of the repression which these wishes have undergone in our minds since childhood."" 
 These ideas, which became a cornerstone of Freud's psychological theories, he named the "" "", and, at one point, he considered calling it the ""Hamlet complex"".  Freud considered that   ""is rooted in the same soil as  ."" But the difference in the ""psychic life"" of the two civilizations that produced each play, and the progress made over time of ""repression in the emotional life of humanity"" can be seen in the way the same material is handled by the two playwrights: In   incest and murder are brought into the light as might occur in a dream, but in   these impulses ""remain repressed"" and we learn of their existence through Hamlet's inhibitions to act out the revenge, while he is shown to be capable of acting decisively and boldly in other contexts. Freud asserts, ""The play is based on Hamlet’s hesitation in accomplishing the task of revenge assigned to him; the text does not give the cause or the motive of this."" The conflict is ""deeply hidden"". 
 Hamlet is able to perform any kind of action except taking revenge on the man who murdered his father and has taken his father's place with his mother—Claudius has led Hamlet to realize the repressed desires of his own childhood. The loathing which was supposed to drive him to revenge is replaced by ""self-reproach, by conscientious scruples"" which tell him ""he himself is no better than the murderer whom he is required to punish"".  Freud suggests that Hamlet's sexual aversion expressed in his ""nunnery"" conversation with Ophelia supports the idea that Hamlet is ""an hysterical subject"". 
 Freud suggests that the character Hamlet goes through an experience that has three characteristics, which he numbered: 1) ""the hero is not psychopathic, but becomes so"" during the course of the play. 2) ""the repressed desire is one of those that are similarly repressed in all of us."" It is a repression that ""belongs to an early stage of our individual development"". The audience identifies with the character of Hamlet, because ""we are victims of the same conflict."" 3) It is the nature of theatre that ""the struggle of the repressed impulse to become conscious"" occurs in both the hero onstage and the spectator, when they are in the grip of their emotions, ""in the manner seen in psychoanalytic treatment"". 
 Freud points out that   is an exception in that psychopathic characters are usually ineffective in stage plays; they ""become as useless for the stage as they are for life itself"", because they do not inspire insight or empathy, unless the audience is familiar with the character's inner conflict. Freud says, ""It is thus the task of the dramatist to transport us into the same illness."" 
 's long-running 1922 performance in  , directed by Thomas Hopkins, ""broke new ground in its Freudian approach to character"", in keeping with the post-World War I rebellion against everything Victorian.  He had a ""blunter intention"" than presenting the genteel, sweet prince of 19th-century tradition, imbuing his character with virility and lust. 
 Beginning in 1910, with the publication of ""The Œdipus-Complex as an Explanation of Hamlet's Mystery: A Study in Motive""   —a psychoanalyst and Freud's biographer—developed Freud's ideas into a series of essays that culminated in his book   (1949). Influenced by Jones's psychoanalytic approach, several productions have portrayed the ""closet scene"", where Hamlet confronts his mother in her private quarters, in a sexual light.  In this reading, Hamlet is disgusted by his mother's ""incestuous"" relationship with Claudius while simultaneously fearful of killing him, as this would clear Hamlet's path to his mother's bed. Ophelia's madness after her father's death may also be read through the Freudian lens: as a reaction to the death of her hoped-for lover, her father. Ophelia is overwhelmed by having her unfulfilled love for him so abruptly terminated and drifts into the oblivion of insanity.  In 1937,   directed   in a Jones-inspired   at  .  Olivier later used some of these same ideas in his 1948 film version of the play.
 In the   volume on Hamlet, editors Bloom and Foster express a conviction that the intentions of Shakespeare in portraying the character of Hamlet in the play exceeded the capacity of the Freudian Oedipus complex to completely encompass the extent of characteristics depicted in Hamlet throughout the tragedy: ""For once, Freud regressed in attempting to fasten the Oedipus Complex upon Hamlet: it will not stick, and merely showed that Freud did better than T.S. Eliot, who preferred   to  , or so he said. Who can believe Eliot, when he exposes his own Hamlet Complex by declaring the play to be an aesthetic failure?""  The book also notes James Joyce's interpretation, stating that he ""did far better in the Library Scene of  , where Stephen marvellously credits Shakespeare, in this play, with universal fatherhood while accurately implying that Hamlet is fatherless, thus opening a pragmatic gap between Shakespeare and Hamlet."" 
 Joshua Rothman has written in   that ""we tell the story wrong when we say that Freud used the idea of the Oedipus complex to understand  "". Rothman suggests that ""it was the other way around:   helped Freud understand, and perhaps even invent, psychoanalysis"". He concludes, ""The Oedipus complex is a misnomer. It should be called the 'Hamlet complex'."" 
 In the 1950s, the French psychoanalyst   analyzed   to illustrate some of his concepts. His   theories about   were first presented in a series of   given in Paris and later published in ""Desire and the Interpretation of Desire in  "". Lacan postulated that the human   is determined by structures of language and that the linguistic structures of   shed light on human desire.  His point of departure is Freud's Oedipal theories, and the central theme of mourning that runs through  .  In Lacan's analysis, Hamlet unconsciously assumes the role of  —the cause of his inaction—and is increasingly distanced from reality ""by mourning,  ,   and  "", which create holes (or  ) in the real, imaginary, and symbolic aspects of his psyche.  Lacan's theories influenced some subsequent literary criticism of   because of his alternative vision of the play and his use of   to explore the play's psychological landscape. 
 In the 20th century,   opened up new approaches to Gertrude and Ophelia.   and   critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment.  They focused on the   of   England, pointing to the common trinity of  , with   outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of   is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, can be seen as honest and fair; however, it is virtually impossible to link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait. 
 's 1957 essay ""The Character of Hamlet's Mother"" defends Gertrude, arguing that the text never hints that Gertrude knew of Claudius poisoning King Hamlet. This analysis has been praised by many feminist critics, combating what is, by Heilbrun's argument, centuries' worth of misinterpretation. By this account, Gertrude's worst crime is of pragmatically marrying her brother-in-law in order to avoid a power vacuum. This is borne out by the fact that King Hamlet's ghost tells Hamlet to leave Gertrude out of Hamlet's revenge, to leave her to heaven, an arbitrary mercy to grant to a conspirator to murder. 
 Ophelia has also been defended by feminist critics, most notably  .  Ophelia is surrounded by powerful men: her father, brother, and Hamlet. All three disappear: Laertes leaves, Hamlet abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories had argued that without these three powerful men making decisions for her, Ophelia is driven into madness.  Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt because, when Hamlet kills her father, he has fulfilled her sexual desire to have Hamlet kill her father so they can be together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture. 
  is one of the   works in the English language, and is often included on lists of the world's greatest literature.  As such, it reverberates through the writing of later centuries. Academic Laurie Osborne identifies the direct influence of   in numerous modern narratives, and divides them into four main categories: fictional accounts of the play's composition, simplifications of the story for young readers, stories expanding the role of one or more characters, and narratives featuring performances of the play. 
 English poet   was an early admirer of Shakespeare and took evident inspiration from his work. As John Kerrigan discusses, Milton originally considered writing his epic poem   (1667) as a tragedy.  While Milton did not ultimately go that route, the poem still shows distinct echoes of Shakespearean revenge tragedy, and of   in particular. As scholar Christopher N. Warren argues,  s Satan ""undergoes a transformation in the poem from a Hamlet-like avenger into a Claudius-like usurper,"" a plot device that supports Milton's larger   internationalist project.  The poem also reworks theatrical language from  , especially around the idea of ""putting on"" certain dispositions, as when Hamlet puts on ""an antic disposition,"" similarly to the Son in   who ""can put on / [God's] terrors."" 
 's  , published about 1749, describes a visit to   by Tom Jones and Mr Partridge, with similarities to the ""play within a play"".  In contrast,      , written between 1776 and 1796, not only has a production of   at its core but also creates parallels between the ghost and Wilhelm Meister's dead father.  In the early 1850s, in  ,   focuses on a Hamlet-like character's long development as a writer.  Ten years later,     contains many  -like plot elements: it is driven by revenge-motivated actions, contains ghost-like characters (Abel Magwitch and  ), and focuses on the hero's guilt.  Academic Alexander Welsh notes that   is an ""autobiographical novel"" and ""anticipates psychoanalytic readings of   itself"".  About the same time,  's   was published, introducing Maggie Tulliver ""who is explicitly compared with Hamlet""  though ""with a reputation for sanity"". 
 's first published short story was ""They Played a New Hamlet"" (1895). When Baum had been touring   in the title role, the actor playing the ghost fell through the floorboards, and the rural audience thought it was part of the show and demanded that the actor repeat the fall, because they thought it was funny. Baum would later recount the actual story in an article, but the short story is told from the point of view of the actor playing the ghost.
 In the 1920s,   managed ""a more upbeat version"" of  —stripped of obsession and revenge—in  , though its main parallels are with  's  .  In the 1990s, two novelists were explicitly influenced by  . In  's  ,   is reworked as a song and dance routine, and  's   has Oedipal themes and murder intertwined with a love affair between a  -obsessed writer, Bradley Pearson, and the daughter of his rival.  In the late 20th century,  's novel   draws heavily from   and takes its title from the play's text; Wallace incorporates references to the gravedigger scene, the marriage of the main character's mother to his uncle, and the re-appearance of the main character's father as a ghost.
 There is the story of the woman who read   for the first time and said, ""I don't see why people admire that play so. It is nothing but a bunch of quotations strung together.""

 Shakespeare almost certainly wrote the role of Hamlet for  . He was the chief tragedian of the  , with a capacious memory for lines and a wide emotional range.  Judging by the number of reprints,   appears to have been Shakespeare's fourth most popular play during his lifetime—only  ,   and   eclipsed it.  Shakespeare provides no clear indication of when his play is set; however, as Elizabethan actors performed at the   in contemporary dress on minimal sets, this would not have affected the staging. 
 Firm evidence for specific early performances of the play is scant. It is sometimes argued that the crew of the ship  , anchored off  , performed   in September 1607;  however, this claim is based on a 19th century insert of a 'lost' passage into a period document, and is today widely regarded as a hoax, likely to have been perpetrated by   (not to mention the intrinsic unlikelihood of sailors memorising and performing the play).  More credible is that the play toured in Germany within five years of Shakespeare's death,  and that it was performed before   in 1619 and   in 1637.  Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that, since the contemporary literature contains many allusions and references to   (only   is mentioned more, from Shakespeare), the play was surely performed with a frequency that the historical record misses. 
 All theatres were closed down by the   government during the  .  Even during this time, however, playlets known as   were often performed illegally, including one called   based on act 5, scene 1 of  . 
 The play was revived early in the  . When the existing stock of pre-  plays was divided between the two newly created  ,   was the only Shakespearean favourite that     secured.  It became the first of Shakespeare's plays to be presented with movable   painted with generic scenery behind the   of  .  This new stage convention highlighted the frequency with which Shakespeare shifts dramatic location, encouraging the recurrent criticism of his failure to maintain  .  In the title role, Davenant cast  , who continued to play the Dane until he was 74.    at   produced a version that adapted Shakespeare heavily; he declared: ""I had sworn I would not leave the stage till I had rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act. I have brought it forth without the grave-digger's trick, Osrick, & the fencing match"".  The first actor known to have played Hamlet in North America is Lewis Hallam Jr., in the  's production in Philadelphia in 1759. 
  made his Drury Lane debut as Hamlet in 1783.  His performance was said to be 20 minutes longer than anyone else's, and his lengthy pauses provoked the suggestion by   that ""music should be played between the words"".    was the first actress known to play Hamlet; many women have since played him as a  , to great acclaim.  In 1748,   wrote a Russian adaptation that focused on Prince Hamlet as the embodiment of an opposition to Claudius's tyranny—a treatment that would recur in Eastern European versions into the 20th century.  In the years following America's independence,  , the young nation's leading tragedian, performed   among other plays at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia, and at the   in New York. Although chided for ""acknowledging acquaintances in the audience"" and ""inadequate memorisation of his lines"", he became a national celebrity. 
 From around 1810 to 1840, the best-known Shakespearean performances in the United States were tours by leading London actors—including  ,  ,  ,  , and  . Of these, Booth remained to make his career in the States, fathering the nation's most notorious actor,   (who later assassinated  ), and its most famous Hamlet,  .  Edwin Booth's   at the   in 1875 was described as ""... the dark, sad, dreamy, mysterious hero of a poem. [... acted] in an ideal manner, as far removed as possible from the plane of actual life"".  Booth played Hamlet for 100 nights in the 1864/5 season at the  , inaugurating the era of long-run Shakespeare in America. 
 In the United Kingdom, the actor-managers of the   (including Kean,  , Macready, and  ) staged Shakespeare in a grand manner, with elaborate scenery and costumes.  The tendency of actor-managers to emphasise the importance of their own central character did not always meet with the critics' approval.  's praise for  's performance contains a sideswipe at Irving: ""The story of the play was perfectly intelligible, and quite took the attention of the audience off the principal actor at moments. What is the   coming to?"" 
 In London, Edmund Kean was the first Hamlet to abandon the regal finery usually associated with the role in favour of a plain costume, and he is said to have surprised his audience by playing Hamlet as serious and introspective.  In stark contrast to earlier opulence,  's 1881 production of the Q1 text was an early attempt at reconstructing the Elizabethan theatre's austerity; his only backdrop was a set of red curtains.    played the prince in her popular 1899 London production. In contrast to the ""effeminate"" view of the central character that usually accompanied a female casting, she described her character as ""manly and resolute, but nonetheless thoughtful ... [he] thinks before he acts, a trait indicative of great strength and great spiritual power"". 
 In France, Charles Kemble initiated an enthusiasm for Shakespeare; and leading members of the Romantic movement such as   and   saw his 1827 Paris performance of  , particularly admiring the madness of  's Ophelia.  In Germany,   had become so assimilated by the mid-19th century that   declared that ""Germany is Hamlet"".  From the 1850s, the   tradition in India transformed   into folk performances, with dozens of songs added. 
 Apart from some western troupes' 19th-century visits, the first professional performance of Hamlet in Japan was  's 1903   (""new school theatre"") adaptation.    translated   and produced a performance in 1911 that blended   (""new drama"") and   styles.  This hybrid-genre reached its peak in  's 1955  .  In 1998,   produced an acclaimed version of   in the style of   theatre, which he took to London. 
  and  —two of the 20th century's most influential  —collaborated on the  's seminal  .  While Craig favoured stylised abstraction, Stanislavski, armed with his   explored psychological motivation.  Craig conceived of the play as a    , offering a dream-like vision as seen through Hamlet's eyes alone.  This was most evident in the staging of the first court scene.  The most famous aspect of the production is Craig's use of large, abstract screens that altered the size and shape of the acting area for each scene, representing the character's state of mind spatially or visualising a   progression.  The production attracted enthusiastic and unprecedented worldwide attention for the theatre and placed it ""on the cultural map for Western Europe"". 
 The first modern dress stagings of   happened in 1925 in London and then New York.  Barry Jackson's   opened their production, directed by H.K. Ayliff at the Kingsway Theatre on August 25, 1925.  Ivor Brown reported, ""Many of the first night audience came to scoff and remained to hold its breath, to marvel and enjoy. . . .Shakespeare's victory over time and tailoring was swift and sweeping.""  Horace Brisbin Liveright's modern dress production opened at the Booth Theater in New York on November 9, 1925, the same night that the London production moved to Birmingham. It was known ""more dryly, and perhaps with a touch of something more sinister, as 'the plain-clothes  '"" and did not reach the same level of success. 
  is often played with contemporary political overtones.  's 1926 production at the Berlin Staatstheater portrayed Claudius's court as a parody of the corrupt and fawning court of  .  In  , the number of productions of   has tended to increase at times of political unrest, since its political themes (suspected crimes, coups, surveillance) can be used to comment on a contemporary situation.  Similarly,   directors have used the play at times of occupation: a 1941   production ""emphasised, with due caution, the helpless situation of an intellectual attempting to endure in a ruthless environment"".  In China, performances of Hamlet often have political significance: Gu Wuwei's 1916  , an amalgam of   and  , was an attack on  's attempt to overthrow the republic.  In 1942,   directed the play in a   temple in  , to which the government had retreated from the advancing Japanese.  In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the   at  , Lin Zhaohua staged a 1990   in which the prince was an ordinary individual tortured by a loss of meaning. In this production, the actors playing Hamlet, Claudius and Polonius exchanged roles at crucial moments in the performance, including the moment of Claudius's death, at which point the actor mainly associated with Hamlet fell to the ground. 
 Notable stagings in London and New York include Barrymore's 1925 production at the  ; it influenced subsequent performances by   and  .  Gielgud played the central role many times: his 1936 New York production ran for 132 performances, leading to the accolade that he was ""the finest interpreter of the role since Barrymore"".  Although ""posterity has treated   less kindly"", throughout the 1930s and 1940s he was regarded by many as the leading interpreter of Shakespeare in the United States and in the 1938/39 season he presented  's first uncut  , running four and a half hours.  Evans later performed a highly truncated version of the play that he played for South Pacific war zones during World War II which made the prince a more decisive character. The staging, known as the ""G.I. Hamlet"", was produced on Broadway for 131 performances in 1945/46.  Olivier's 1937 performance at The Old Vic was popular with audiences but not with critics, with   writing in a famous review in   ""Mr. Olivier does not speak poetry badly. He does not speak it at all.""  In 1937   directed the play at Elsinore, Denmark, with Laurence Olivier as Hamlet and Vivien Leigh as Ophelia.
 In 1963, Olivier directed   as Hamlet in the inaugural performance of the newly formed  ; critics found resonance between O'Toole's Hamlet and  's hero, Jimmy Porter, from  . 
  received his third Tony Award nomination when he played his second Hamlet, his first under John Gielgud's direction, in 1964 in a production that holds the record for the longest run of the play in Broadway history (137 performances). The performance was set on a bare stage, conceived to appear like a dress rehearsal, with Burton in a black v-neck sweater, and Gielgud himself tape-recorded the voice for the ghost (which appeared as a looming shadow). It was immortalised both on record and on a film that played in US theatres for a week in 1964 as well as being the subject of books written by cast members William Redfield and Richard L. Sterne.
 Other New York portrayals of   of note include that of  's in 1995 (for which he won the   for Best Actor)—which ran, from first preview to closing night, a total of one hundred performances. About the Fiennes     wrote in   that it was ""... not one for literary sleuths and Shakespeare scholars.

Fellow actor and friend,  , said that Charleson played Hamlet so well it was as if he had rehearsed the role all his life; McKellen called it ""the perfect Hamlet"".  The performance garnered other major accolades as well, some critics echoing McKellen in calling it the definitive Hamlet performance.

en.wikipedia.org,Year-riddle - Wikipedia,"The   is one of the most widespread, and apparently most ancient, international  -types in Eurasia. This type of riddle is first attested in   tradition thought to originate in the second millennium BCE.
 Studies have surveyed the exceptionally wide attestation of this riddle type.  The riddle is conventionally thought to been eastern in origin,  though this may simply reflect the early date of writing in the east. A variety of guiding metaphors appear in the Year-riddle, and it can be helpful to analyse its variants on these lines.  It has been argued that 'versions usually express the conventional tropes of a given culture or society and indicate regional sources'. 
 Year-riddles are numbered 984, 1037 and 1038 in    .  As a folktale motif, the riddle is motif H721 in the classificatory system established by    . 
 Most year-riddles are guided by one (or more) of four metaphors: wheels, trees, animals (particularly human families), and artefacts (particularly architecture).
 The first three all make an appearance in the year-riddle that appears in several versions of the  . This story seems to have originated in   around the late seventh or early sixth century BCE.  The relevant passage is lost from the earliest surviving versions, but the following instance, from a later   version, is thought likely to represent the early form of the text:
 [The king] said to me, “Aḥiḳar, expound to me this riddle: A pillar has on its head twelve cedars; in every cedar there are thirty wheels, and in every wheel two cables, one white and one black.” And I answered and said to him, “(...) The pillar of which thou hast spoken to me is the year: the twelve cedars are the  twelve  months  of  the  year;  the  thirty  wheels  are  the  thirty  days  of  the month; the two cables, one white and one black, are the day and the night. Ancient Indian sources afford the earliest attestations of the year-riddle: examples in the   are thought to originate c. 1500×1200 BCE. Their use of metaphors of wheels reflects the prominence of the concept of the   in Asian culture. 
  of the   of the   can be understood to comprise a series of riddles or enigmas.  Many are now obscure, but may have been an enigmatic exposition of the  .    1.164.11 runs:
 दवादशारं नहि तज्जराय  
वर्वर्ति चक्रं परि दयां रतस्य 
आ पुत्रा अग्ने मिथुनासो अत्र  
सप्त शतानि विंशतिश्च तस्थु 
 duvā daśāraṃ nahí táj járāya 
várvarti cakrám pári dyā m r̥tásya 
ā  putrā  agne mithunā so átra 
saptá śatā ni viṃśatíś ca tasthuḥ 
 With twelve spokes—for it does not become old— 
the wheel of the truthful order turns on and on around the sky.  
Sons, in pairs, o Agni, 
seven hundred and twenty, are standing. 
  
 Meanwhile, 1.164.48 gives:
 दवादश परधयश्चक्रमेकं  
तरीणि नभ्यानि क उ तच्चिकेत 
तस्मिन साकं तरिशता न शङकवो. 
अर्पिताः षष्टिर्न चलाचलासः 
 duvā daśa pradháyaś cakrám ékaṃ 
trī ṇi nábhyāni ká u tác ciketa 
tásmin sākáṃ · triśatā  ná śaṅkávo 
arpitā ḥ ṣaṣṭír ná calācalā saḥ 
 The felly-pieces are twelve, the wheel is one, 
the nave-pieces three; who has understood this? 
On it are placed, as it were, 360  
pegs that do not wobble. 
  
 Likewise, in the  , the riddles posed to   by   in the   begin with the year-riddle: what has six naves, twelve axles, twenty-four joints, and three hundred and sixty spokes? 
 A later Indic example using a similar metaphor is from the   ascribed to   (1253–1325):
 
 
 Twelve horses, thirty pullers, 
Passengers, three hundred and fifty-five 
Come summer, winter or storm, 
Never stop—always mobile. 
 Here the three hundred and fifty-five days of the year correspond to the twelve lunar cycles of the   year. 
 A large number of variants (numbered 1037-38 in Archer Taylor's  ) compare the year to a tree; indeed, 'riddlers rarely use the scene of a tree and its branches for other subjects than the year and the months or the sun and its rays'.  The tree is also the metaphor usually found in Arabic folktales.  The popularity of tree-imagery is thought to echo the widespread popularity of   or   in Eurasian traditions. 
 Most year-riddles of this kind can be thought of as containing some or all of the following components:  
 Versions containing only parts of the tree occur across Eurasia, whereas the versions with the nests occur only in Europe. 
 Examples include this verse from the early eleventh-century  :
 What are the dozen cypresses erect 
In all their bravery and loveliness, 
Each one of them with thirty boughs bedeckt-- 
In Persia never more and never less?. 
 To which   responds
 First as to those twelve cypresses which rear 
Themselves, with thirty boughs upon each tree: 
They are the twelve new moons of every years, 
Like new-made monarchs, throned in majesty. 
Upon the thirtieth day its course is done 
For each; thus our revolving periods run. 
 Later examples include:
 
 
 What is that good tree, green-veiled, 
Its branches are twelve in number, 
If you count from the face of intelligence, 
Thirty leaves on every branch you will find. 
Year 
 Yonder stands a tree of honor, 
twelve limbs grow upon her, 
every limb a different name. 
It would take a wise man to tell you the same. [English] 
 A tree with twelve branches and thirty leaves, of which fifteen are black and fifteen white, strewn with open flowers of whitish yellow [Malay] There stands a tree with twelve branches, on each branch are four nests, in each nest are six young, and the seventh is the mother. [Lithuanian] More elaborate variations on this theme are also found. One Icelandic example is preserved in three early-modern manuscripts of the riddle-contest in the medieval   and runs:   ('what is that assembly which has twelve flowers, and in each flower are four nests? And in each nest are seven birds and each has its own name? How are they guessed? 12 months, 4 weeks, 7 days'). 
 Human families provide a guiding metaphor for a number of year riddles (numbered 984 in Archer Taylor's  ), though almost never in English-language tradition.   Although only first attested in the roughly tenth-century CE  , the following Greek riddle is there ascribed to   (fl. C6 BCE); even if it is not that ancient, the attribution to him would suggest that the riddle was thought of in Ancient Greek culture as itself being very old:
 
 
 There is one father and twelve children; of these each 
Has twice thirty daughters of different appearance: 
Some are white to look at and the others black in turn; 
They are immortal and yet they all fade away. 
 Another example of the family metaphor is this French riddle, first published in 1811:
 
 
 We are twelve sisters, daughters of the same father, 
Not always of the same mother. 
Each one successively  
Gives birth to four males, 
Who produce similarly,  
At equal intervals  
More than three hundred daughters a day,  
Each in his turn.  
Those male ones are born from their females;  
We are born just as those female ones are;  
The male ones form us, we form them,  
After which we start again.
 The only English-language example of this kind of year-riddle found by Taylor was from   in the  : ' '. — 'Twelve months of the year, de second one February'. 
 Eastern Europe and Asia exhibit a range of other animal metaphors for the year, usually involving a team of twelve oxen pulling one plough or gatherings of different species of birds. 
 A number of year-riddles use man-made objects as their controlling metaphor. For example, a modern Greek riddle invokes a cask made with twelve staves, and a   riddle the contents of a chest. But most often these riddles draw on architecture,  as in the following mid-twentieth-century example from central  :
 Ein-daw-thar-lan: 
 set-nhit khan: 
ta khan: thone gyait 
ah phay eit 
phwiṇ hlet ta gar: 
lay: paut htar: 
win bu twet bu bar yẹ lar: 
 
Hnit It is a beautiful house with twelve rooms and thirty people can sleep in each room. There are four doors left open. Have you ever passed through these doors?

 The date of the first of such events is disputed. According to the   (NABH), the Salt Lake Home Builders Association held the first Parade of Homes in the United States in 1946.  According to Samuel Dodd, writing in the  , the first housing show was organized in 1948 by the NABH under the brand Parade of Homes.  The nation's first home-tour organization was established in Minnesota in 1948 by the Builders Association of the Twin Cities (now known as Housing First Minnesota).

 The Parade of Homes presented by Housing First Minnesota is the largest housing show in the nation.   The event runs twice a year, once in the spring and once in the fall, with participation peaking at 1,259 home entries in a single event in 2006.

According to Advaita Vedanta,  , by the nature of its content, possesses a unique quality of ultimacy that annuls any supposed ultimacy that might be attached to any other or form of knowledge, and is intuitively gained as self-certifying. Once Brahman is realized all other modes of knowledge are seen to be touched by  , the root of ignorance. In this context,   means true knowledge. 
However, it is argued that the Advaita Vedanta interpretation does not answer the final question: what is the reality or truth-value of   or what is the substratum that is the basis or cause of  ? 
 The Upanishads teach that the knowledge of difference is   or ignorance, and the knowledge of identity is true knowledge or   or valid knowledge, which leads to life eternal. For the  , perception is the only means of valid knowledge ( ). Vadi Deva Suri of the   defines valid knowledge as determinate cognition which apprehends itself and an object and which is capable of prompting activity which attains a desirable object or rejects an undesirable object; the result of valid knowledge is cessation of ignorance.   recognized four kinds of valid knowledge – Perception, Inference, Recollection and Intuition. The Mimamsa schools introduced the concept of intrinsic validity of knowledge ( ) and extrinsic validity of knowledge ( ) but agreed that the validity of knowledge cannot be determined by the knowledge of any special excellence in its cause or the knowledge of its harmony with the real nature of its object or the knowledge of a fruitful action.   accepted perception, inference, scriptural testimony, comparison, presumption and non-apprehension as the six sources of knowledge and concluded that the knowledge which corresponds with the real nature of its object is valid. The Atman is the reality in the empirical self as the ever-present foundational subject-objectless universal consciousness which sustains the empirical self. 
 In   the movement starts from the outer extremities and gradually penetrates into the inmost recesses of the soul, and the whole investigation is conducted in two spheres, in the subject as well as in the object, in the individual as well as in the world, in the   as also in the  , in the   and also in   spheres and conducted synthetically as well as analytically, through   as well as  , which the   calls   and  . The   do not rest content in knowing the reality simply as a whole but proceed further to comprehend it in all its infinite details too. The higher includes the lower grades and adds something more to it and never rejects it; the lower has its fulfilment in the higher and finds its consummation there but never faces extinction. All forms of contemplation have only one aim: to lead to the Supreme Knowledge and hence they are termed as  ; through  , which is  , one attains immortality (  Verse V.1).  ,   and   are the synthetic way whereas the analytic way is signified by the Sleeping man of the   episode and by the Five Sheaths, which ways show that the world and the individual spring from the same eternal source. 
 In  , goddesses are personifications of the deepest level of power and energy. The concept of  , in its most abstract terms, relates to the energetic principle of ultimate reality, the dynamic aspect of the divine. This concept surfaces in the   as Goddess Umā bestowing   on  ; when linked with   and  , she embodies the power of illusion ( ), encompassing ignorance ( ) and knowledge ( ) and thereby presented with a dual personality. According to the Saktas,   is basically a positive, creative, magical energy of the Goddess that brings forth the universe. The ten   are bestowers or personifications of transcendent and liberating religious knowledge; the term   in this context refers to power, essence of reality and the  . The gentle and motherly forms of Goddess Sri Vidyā are 'right-handed'.  When the awareness of the 'exterior' ( ) combined with the ""I"" encompasses the entire space as ""I"" it is called  . When later, discarding the abstraction of the Self and the exterior, clear identification with the insentient space takes place, it is called  ; the investigation of these two last steps is pure   (knowledge).   , which has been identified with   in the   represents its three  ; also identified with  , which term primarily means the dark abyss of non-being and secondarily the mysterious darkness of the unmanifest state,   binds through   and releases through   . 
 In  ,   means 'non-dual awareness' of  . In  , the word,   , meaning  , similarly refers to non-dualistic awareness or intrinsic awareness.  
 In   texts,   exist in three forms:   (secret),   (knowledge)   (mnemonic). Male Buddhist tantric deities are represented by the grammatically masculine  , while female Buddhist tantric deities are represented by the grammatically feminine  .  The   mantras constitute the knowledge and the mind of all the   and that which possesses the   (essence of  ), and it is this knowledge, according to Cabezon, which ""pacifies the suffering experienced in the existential world ( ) and the heaps of faults such as desire"". 
 In Buddhism, the   ( ;  :  ;  :  ) or ""five sciences"" are the five major classes of knowledge ( ) which   are said to have mastered.

 This edition of the race included ""Leg 0"", a set of 4 offshore races to help generate interest. They included the 2017  , and the 2017  .
 
 As opposed to the previous edition, scoring was based on a high-points system, with the winner of every leg scoring one bonus point (7+1 bonus point for a win, 6 for second, 5 for third, etc.). The two Southern Ocean legs – from Cape Town to Melbourne, and Auckland to Itajaí, plus the North Atlantic leg near the end of the race, Newport to Cardiff – all scored double points. There was a bonus point for the first team to round Cape Horn in a nod to the historic significance of this turning point in the race. A further bonus point was awarded for the team with the best total elapsed time overall in the race. The In-Port Series didn't count in the overall points but remained the tiebreaker should teams be tied on points at the finish in The Hague.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/20180622_Aarhus_Volvo_Ocean_Race_Vestas_0205_%2841146297340%29.jpg/275px-20180622_Aarhus_Volvo_Ocean_Race_Vestas_0205_%2841146297340%29.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Volvo_Ocean_Race_finish_Scheveningen_The_Hague.jpg/220px-Volvo_Ocean_Race_finish_Scheveningen_The_Hague.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg/23px-Flag_of_France.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_Spain.svg/23px-Flag_of_Spain.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_Spain.svg/23px-Flag_of_Spain.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg/20px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg/23px-Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg/23px-Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Flag_of_the_United_Nations.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_Nations.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_Spain.svg/23px-Flag_of_Spain.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_Spain.svg/23px-Flag_of_Spain.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Flag_of_Portugal.svg/23px-Flag_of_Portugal.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Flag_of_Portugal.svg/23px-Flag_of_Portugal.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Flag_of_Portugal.svg/23px-Flag_of_Portugal.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Flag_of_South_Africa.svg/23px-Flag_of_South_Africa.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Flag_of_South_Africa.svg/23px-Flag_of_South_Africa.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Flag_of_South_Africa.svg/23px-Flag_of_South_Africa.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg/23px-Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg/23px-Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg/23px-Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg/23px-Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg/23px-Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg/23px-Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg/23px-Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg/23px-Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg/23px-Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/w

en.wikipedia.org,User:Ergo Sum - Wikipedia,"Welcome to my user page. Should you care to know, my interests and contributions are fairly eclectic. I enjoy law and philosophy, and am a big history buff. I do my best to make no mistakes, but as a human, I am fallible. If you believe I have acted in error or just want to say hello, feel free to stop by my talk page. Insofar as one may generalize, I am both an inclusionist and an incrementalist, but there are certainly exceptions to both.
 
 The name ""Ergo Sum"" derives from the famous proposition by French philosopher  , "" ,"" which translates from the   as ""I think, therefore I am."" This statement was the conclusion of his argument for the proof of the existence of the self as a thinking being, thereby ameliorating the problem of   (although Descartes himself treated this problem only as  ). The immense power of this simple statement permits the existence of knowledge and validates the   endeavor. While innumerable philosophers went on to challenge various aspects of this argument, the Cartesian impact is still pervasive throughout the field of   today.
 The next question you might rightly ask is, ""what does this have to do with Wikipedia?"" Right. As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia is (ideally) a repository of human knowledge, which is to say, it contains all of and only that which is true. The veracity of a postulation may be tested   or   (the latter being logically necessary due to  's  ), but all inquiries rest on the presupposition that the acquisition of knowledge is, in fact, possible. As such, the organization of inquiry into a methodological study of knowledge, epistemology, is forever indebted to Descartes.
 It should be noted that Descartes is not alone in deserving laudation by those who cherish the rigorous and systematic study of reality, which, if not the definition, is at least the essence of philosophy.
 
 The following are articles and other pages I've created, with a few that I've primarily contributed to but not

en.wikipedia.org,Wikipedia:VisualEditor/Why/User Test Data - Wikipedia,"As part of our preparations for the 2013 launch we ran a group of users from   through a set of tasks, first using the VisualEditor and then using wiki markup. Some of them had tried to edit in the past; many were total newcomers. The script for the tests can be  . This is not the only data we are relying on; we are also (and more usefully)   from a test on the English-language Wikipedia, in which 50 percent of new users were given the VisualEditor by default.
 When presented with the source editor, users tended to have the same set of problems. Many of these centred around identifying what they were expected to change; with so much markup, they found it difficult to identify things in the markup view that matched what they'd seen when reading the rendered page. Users were also worried by the clutter of the editing interface, particularly the mass of buttons at the bottom of the ""save page"" window.
 Users struggled to understand the wikimarkup found in a moderately-sized article; when they managed to identify bits, it was almost entirely from comparing their memory of the rendered page to individual words, and looking at the formatting around those words (for example, noting that all of the headers had equals signs, and thus determining that equals signs made headers work). With one exception, every user found the source editor intimidating and would opt not to use it.
 Several problems were raised with the VisualEditor. Many users found adding links to be confusing, something we have noted and are evaluating, and (as known) the VisualEditor was slow to load for some testers. Several other (now fixed) bugs, such as problems with saving the page, also frustrated users. However, all but one of the testers concluded that they preferred using the VisualEditor to using the source editor, one of them noting that ""[with the VisualEditor] I would be more likely to make edits. That interface was a lot easier to understand and I had more confidence that the changes I was making were the changes that I wanted to make. I also like that I had an opportunity to review the changes and note them.""
 This is a test of a new editing interface for Wikipedia pages. We will be testing whether it is easier to edit Wikipedia using the current editing interface or the new interface.
In this scenario, let's say that you've decided to correct the article ""Golden-Crowned Sparrow"". Try to make the corrections that we give throughout, and then tell us what parts of the process felt confusing, and whether it was easier or more difficult to make the corrections with the first interface you are presented with, or the second interface.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/VisualEditor-logo.svg/200px-VisualEditor-logo.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:VisualEditor/Why/User_Test_Data

Voter attitudes include characteristics such as  ,  , degree of satisfaction with the existing government, public policy leanings, and feelings about a candidate's personality traits.  Social factors include  ,  ,  , educational level, regional characteristics, and  .  The degree to which a person identifies with a political party influences voting behavior,  as does  .  Voter decision-making is not a purely rational endeavor but rather is profoundly influenced by personal and social   and deeply held beliefs  as well as characteristics such as personality,  ,  , and other  .    and avoidance of   through   can impact voting behavior.
 Voter behavior is often influenced by voter loyalty.  There is a correlation between voter satisfaction with what a   has achieved and dealt with a situation and voters' intention of voting for the same party again.  Thus, if there is high voter satisfaction with how the political party performed, then the likelihood of a reoccurring vote in the next election is high.  Additionally, the information supplied to the voter is significant in understanding voting behavior. The information provided to the voter, not only influences who to vote for, but if they are intending too at all. 
 Three cleavage-based voting factors, or individual differences impacting voting behavior, focused on in existing research are  ,  , and  .  In recent years, voting cleavage has shifted from concerns of   vs   religions to have a larger focus on religious vs   leanings.  Traditional conceptions of class voting dictate a working-class preference towards   and   preference for  . The influences of class voting is reliant on political environment and location, many nations observe the opposite preferences. 
 Many cleavage-based voting behaviors are interconnected and frequently build on each other.  These factors also tend to hold different levels of weight in different countries, based on their political environment, meaning that there is no universal explanation for voting cleavage in all   countries.  Each factor has a different level of importance and influence on one's vote dependent on the country one is voting in. 
 Research following the   identified four distinct voting behaviors depending on the election type.  Citizens use different decision criteria if they are called to exercise their right to vote in  ,  ,   or in a  . 
 In  , voters usually vote based on their  .  In  , voters tend to vote for those who seem more capable to contribute to their area.  Voting behavior for   differs slightly, as people vote for or against a clearly defined policy. 
  voting is also an important motive behind an individual's vote and can influence voting behavior.  A 2000 research study on partisanship voting in the   found evidence that partisan voting has a large effect on voting behavior.  However, partisan voting has a larger effect on  , such as a  , than it does on  .  Furthermore, there is also a distinction of partisan voting behavior relative to a voter's age and education. Those over fifty years old and those without a   are more likely to vote based on partisan loyalty.  Additionally, the voting behavior tendencies of different groups may shift over time; for example, in the  , voters with college degrees have shifted significantly toward   candidates over the past three decades.  This research is based on the   and has not been confirmed to accurately predict voting patterns in other democracies. 
 A 1960 study of   found that citizens living in   areas were more likely to be supportive of socialist or progressive parties, while citizens living in   areas were favorable of conservative parties. 
 Voters have also been shown to be affected by   and   politics, and whether such coalitions form before or after an election.  In these cases, voters can be swayed by feelings on coalition partners when considering their feelings toward their preferred  . 
  is an important factor to consider when making inferences regarding voting behavior. Gender often interacts with factors such as region,  , occupational differences, age,  , educational level, and other characteristics to produce a distinct multiplicative effect on voting behavior.  Much of the research on gender differences in voting behavior has centered on the   and   of women in the   towards the   in the 1980s.  More recent research focusing on the partisan   in the   suggests that this gender gap is actually a race gap, as   in the U.S. have consistently been supporters of the   and were more likely to vote for   over   in the  .  More recent and forthcoming research expands this focus to a global perspective, using   perceptions of gender differences in voting behavior to make predictions that factor in the role of   in voting decisions. 
 In the  ,   was the first nation to grant women the legal  , in 1893.  The vast majority of nations officially granted women the right to vote over the past century, though many women were prevented from voting for decades, such as Black women in many regions of the United States. prior to the 1960s.  As of 2023, virtually all nations other than   officially grant women the legal right to vote, though significant barriers exist to   in many places that can make casting a ballot impossible or near impossible.  Examples include  , where women are not allowed to travel more than 72 kilometers without a male chaperone,  and parts of  , where many women could not vote in recent elections due to election-related  . 
 Research on gender differences in voting has historically focused on economically advanced,  , though there is a growing body of research on women's voting preferences in lower income nations.  Research has demonstrated that gender differences in voting exist worldwide.  The cause of this   often varies by   and region.  Frequently utilized explanations for gender gaps in voting are  , situational constraints for women, and differences in political priorities.  Studies indicate that the way these factors interact with voting behavior depends on location,  ,  ,  lived experience, and other facets of identity including  ,  , and age.  It is thus important to employ an   lens - meaning, one in which race, ethnicity,  ,  , educational status, and other factors are considered -  and explore gender within the context of these other factors to understand voting behavior more fully. 
 Influences on candidate choice have been linked to three main influences on voting behavior.  These influences include, but are not limited to, issue and   beliefs, perceptions of government performance, and personal evaluation of candidate characteristics.  These factors are influenced by a range of compounding factors including  . 
 Voters must hold   on the subject and recognize differences between the candidates on it in order for it to influence their choice of candidate.  Oftentimes, voters will hold viewpoints that are too unstable to serve as a benchmark for comparing the candidates, while others won't detect any significant distinctions between them on the subject.  Other voters will have firm opinions and distinct   of candidate differences, specifically when the candidates directly indicate their distinctions.  Relating back to voting behavior, the crucial point is not whether voters have a specific candidate or policy choice, but rather how much they differentiate between candidates on policy matters and decide who to vote for on that basis. 
  influences these views on policy. In the  , ideology affects how voters cast their ballots in   based on their beliefs on certain policy concerns. Another method of influence is  , which working with ideology may also shape the ways in which voters perceive policy. 
 There is mixed research regarding whether or not a   in partisan preferences exists, and if it does exist to what extent.  Research that affirms the existence of this gap emphasizes that younger women in particular are more likely to support     candidates than men.  The cause of this shift is still being explored, but one prevalent theory holds that gendered differences in voting behavior can at least in part be attributed to the growing presence of   due to  , improved accessibility of women to the education system, the questioning of traditional  ,  and the disproportionate amount of unpaid caregiving work that women perform.  These developments have led younger women to be more supportive of   that tend to prioritize issues especially   to women. 
 A relevant example to this point are right-leaning parties that have addressed relevant economic issues such as state-funded childcare, such as the   under   between 1997 and 2010, have since had more success winning votes from younger women. 
 Voting behavior is significantly influenced by   assessments of government performance, which should be differentiated from the influence of policy issues.  Different opinions on what the government ought to do are involved in policy concerns, which are prospective or based on what will happen. Performance assessments, which are retrospective, contain differences regarding how effectively the government has performed. 
  and voter gender can affect voter perceptions of government performance.  A 2019 study surveying a nationally representative sample of   citizens, found that women's   in political-decision-making bodies builds trust and broad approval of these bodies across policy outcomes and areas. 
 Voters frequently weigh candidates’ personal qualities such as experience,  , morals,  ,  , and leadership potential. 
 These established opinions of candidates' traits are developed in addition to how they view them in terms of political and policy issues, and these judgments have a significant impact on voting decisions.  The candidates' perceived  , concern, sincerity, dependability, and   ability have been found to be one crucial feature of their  .  Which qualities matter and how these perceptions are formed is intertwined with a variety of identity factors including gender. 
 Historically,   has been disproportionately held by men.  This unrepresentative balance is still reflected today with the vast majority of the highest political offices occupied by men.  This trend holds even in democracies where political positions are technically accessible to all genders.  This disparity is a product of a multitude of factors, but some suggest that the   of voters plays a role in maintaining this political  . 
 Physical characteristics of political candidates impact voter bias in a uniquely gendered way.  A study from 2008 found that men are more likely to vote for   female candidates whereas women are more likely to vote for approachable male candidates.  This finding echoes the different standards women candidates are required to fulfill in contrast to male candidates to be taken seriously as contenders in political races. 
 Research also indicates that the gender of a political candidate changes the way voters evaluate political qualifications.  What voters want to know about a candidate varies by the candidate's  . For female candidates, voters seek out more  -related information like   and occupational experience than they do for male candidates. Thus, the information voters seek about candidates is gendered in a way that indirectly impacts voting behavior. There is an overall bias that suggests that voters are using the candidates gender to make assumptions about political factors that are relatively closer to their own.    Some female voters naturally feel that women will untimely connect and understand their beliefs.    
 There is also evidence that the presence of a female candidate encourages political engagement in voting.  The mere presence of a female candidate has been found to increase women's  .  This finding supports the idea that the   of women in campaigns impacts the overall political attitudes and voting behavior of women. 
 Gender differences in voting behavior are components of gendered differences in  .  Political engagement refers to methods of individual involvement with political practices and can be broken down into   political engagement and unconventional political engagement.  Conventional practices include  , letter-writing, and signing  .  Unconventional practices include participating in non-violent and violent  ,  , and  . 
 Numerous cross-national studies have found that women are less likely to engage in   practices broadly.  This means that women are less likely to engage in the practice of voting all together. Notable exceptions to this include voter engagement in the  , where women have higher voter turnout rates in  , but are still less likely to participate in other forms of conventional and unconventional  . 
 A study based in   found that women with access to educational resources and who possess and live in societies that promote   values and practices are more likely to engage in politics than those who lack access to education and who live in societies with more   norms and practices, in which   are more prevalent and women are viewed as essentially "" "" and fundamentally different from men. 
  in the   are much more likely than White women and then   to vote for   candidates, a trend that has persisted since the 1960s,  and are far more likely to vote than their   would predict.    From 1980 to 2016, 91% of votes cast by Black voters were for Democrats, compared to 40% among Whites.   While income usually is associated with propensity to vote, this does not appear to hold true for  .  Analyses of data from the U.S. Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a large survey that matches respondents to their voter file records, has found that low income   have a significantly higher predicted voting rate compared to  , White men, or White women in the same  .  While the researchers found that income did strongly predict voting participation among White people, it played less of a role in voter participation among  .  Some have theorized that this increased voter participation occurs because voting and other civic engagement are ways of coping with the stress of persistent  .   
 Much of the above discussion pertains to women's voting preferences in the   and  . Recent  trends in  , the world's largest democracy, have found that women are more likely to vote along religious, rather than  , lines, even when parties offer policies that might appear to benefit women.  A survey of voters in  , India, found that voters’ party choice was associated with occupation and newspaper choice and not gender,  , or income.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Election_in_Japan2016_Summer.jpg/220px-Election_in_Japan2016_Summer.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Donald_Trump_and_Hillary_Clinton_during_United_States_presidential_election_2016.jpg/220px-Donald_Trump_and_Hillary_Clinton_during_United_States_presidential_election_2016.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Women_voting_afghanistan_2004_usaid.jpg/220px-Women_voting_afghanistan_2004_usaid.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Prime_Minister_David_Cameron%2C_speaking_at_the_London_Summit_on_Family_Planning_%287554893808%29.jpg/220px-Prime_Minister_David_Cameron%2C_speaking_at_the_London_Summit_on_Family_Planning_%287554893808%29.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Congressional_Black_Caucus_women_2019.jpg/220px-Congressional_Black_Caucus_women_2019.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/28px-Psi2.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Socrates.png/18px-Socrates.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg/28px-A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_behavior
en.wikipedia.org,Galápagos (novel) - Wikipedia,"(1985) is the eleventh novel published by American author  . Set in the   after a global financial disaster, the novel questions the merit of the human brain from an evolutionary perspective. The title is both a reference to the islands on which part of the story plays out, and a tribute to  , on whose theory Vonnegut relies to reach his own conclusions. It was published by  .
  is the story of a small band of mismatched humans who are shipwrecked on the fictional island of Santa Rosalia in the   after a global financial crisis cripples the world's economy. Shortly thereafter, a disease renders all humans on Earth infertile, with the exception of the people on Santa Rosalia, making them the last specimens of humankind. Over the next million years, their descendants, the only fertile humans left on the planet, eventually evolve into a furry species resembling  : though possibly still able to walk upright (it is not explicitly mentioned, but it is stated that they occasionally catch land animals), they have a   with teeth adapted for catching fish, a streamlined skull and flipper-like hands with   fingers (described as "" "").
 The story's narrator is a spirit who has been watching over humans for the last million years. This particular ghost is the immortal spirit of Leon Trotsky Trout, son of Vonnegut's recurring character  . Leon is a   who is affected by the massacres in Vietnam. He goes   and settles in  , where he works as a shipbuilder and dies during the construction of the ship, the  . This ship is used for the ""Nature Cruise of the Century"". Planned as a celebrity cruise, it was in limbo due to the economic downturn, and due to a chain of unconnected events the ship ended up allowing humans to reach and survive in the Galápagos. A group of girls from a   tribe living in the Amazon rainforest, called the Kanka-bono girls also end up on the ship, eventually having children with sperm obtained from the ship's captain.
 The deceased Kilgore Trout makes four appearances in the novel, urging his son to enter the ""blue tunnel"" that leads to the afterlife. When Leon refuses for the fourth time, Kilgore pledges that he, and the blue tunnel, will not return for one million years, which leaves Leon to observe the slow process of evolution that transforms the humans into aquatic mammals. The process begins when a Japanese woman on the island, the granddaughter of a   survivor, gives birth to a fur-covered daughter.
 Trout maintains that all the sorrows of humankind were caused by ""the only true villain in my story: the oversized human brain"".   eliminates this problem, since the humans best fitted to Santa Rosalia were those who could swim best, which required a streamlined head, which in turn required a smaller brain.
 The main story is told a-chronologically with a framing story told by a narrator from a point a million years in the future, interspersed with flashbacks and commentary about the outcomes of future events of the main storyline.  As a gimmick, an asterisk is placed in front of a character's name if they will die before sunset.
 The novel contains a large number of quotations from other authors. They are related to the story itself and are functionally inserted through Mandarax, a fictional voice translator that is also able to provide quotations from literature and history. The following authors are quoted (in order of their appearance in the book):  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , Noble Claggett,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  .
 In 2009,   produced an audio version of  , narrated by  , as part of its   line of audiobooks.
 In 2014, artists Tucker Marder and   adapted ""Galapagos"" into a live theatrical performance at the new   in Watermill, N.Y. Endorsed by the   Estate, the multi-media production featured 26 performers including Bob Balaban; live orchestral underscoring composed and conducted by Forrest Gray featuring Max Feldschuh on vibraphone and Ken Sacks on mbira; animal costumes by Isla Hansen; a three-story scenic design by Shelby Jackson; experimental video projections by James Bayard; and choreography by Matt Davies.
 In 2019, Canadian band The PepTides released a ten-song collection titled ""Galápagos Vol.1"",  inspired by the themes and characters in Galápagos.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-Ambox_important.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0f/Galapagos%28Vonnegut%29.jpg/200px-Galapagos%28Vonnegut%29.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_(novel)

  Whatever regime we set up a dedicated commercial enterprise can find a way around it. It would take some time to work up an account with whatever ""NPP reviewer"" user-right but it is trivial when there is money on the table. At that point our best option is tying the user right to the Terms of Use by saying anyone with the 'NPP user right' may not receive compensation for their editing (with the usual carve outs for GLAM, WiR, employees of the Foundation etc.). As to   Orangemoody type things that requires either mentoring or a   of experience. AGF ties our hands because we are suposed to deal with each new editor as a naive but well-intentioned person who just needs some proper guidance and each NPP must figure out how to manage that. I have never seen anything that tells us how to spot and deal with bad-faith paid editors etc. If we try to figure it out we are called 'deletionist' and 'over-zealous' which sooner or later leads to people giving up or becoming ass-holes with a smaller number figuring out how to manage on their own. Of course giving guidance on recognizing articles being pushed by puppet-farms will become useless almost as soon as they are posted. It would be so much easier if we just had a   controlling NPP :)  Since one of the major purposes of this user right is to prevent paid editing rings from inserting material into Wikipedia without review we must remember that all advanced user rights have   to a commercial editing ring. The only way to limit the number of times our process will be subverted is to make the investment in time   more than or very close to the actual cash value of having the user right.  I know that it is kind of bureaucratic and that is antithetical to many Wikipedians but erecting barriers to entry that do not restrict good-faith editors   is really the only defense volunteers have against those who are trying to make money off of the project.   20:36, 8 September 2015 (UTC) I'm strongly against stopping good-faith new users create and otherwise work with new articles. What I suggest is better use of the Draft namespace. Maybe 'new' users could automatically have their new articles appear in draft rather than article space?   ( ) 20:17, 13 September 2015 (UTC) 
 Should we remove the bot flagging ability from bureaucrats and add it to a newly created a BAG user group?   07:21, 13 July 2015 (UTC) 
 - or to the Bureaucrats' noticeboard.   ( ) 08:05, 13 July 2015 (UTC)

 The assignment of bot status was up until April 2006 within the technical remit of stewards, with requests being made on meta. In keeping with their usual role, the stewards deferred to local communities to determine the consensus for bots to run and issued flags based on the approval decisions of groups on local Wikis such as BAG, where these existed. When the technical ability to assign flags was given to bureaucrats, they assumed the same role as the stewards had previously played - acting on the advice of the Bot Approvals Group. In some situations where BAG have been unable to reach a consensus, they have asked bureaucrats to aid them in making certain determinations - e.g. whether there is consensus for someone to join BAG. However, the local community has never accorded bureaucrats an ""oversight"" role over bot operations. It is a misunderstanding to think that bureaucrats have delegated the task of bot review to BAG. Unlike the promotion of new administrators or the performing of rename, the bureaucrat role here is largely technical.
 This is reflected in that fact that where the assignment of a flag is not needed, bureaucrats have no role at all in the approval process. Examples of such situations would be:
 BAG is mandated by the community to determine the technical suitability of a bot, its compliance with policy and whether a consensus for a task exists. It follows that bureaucrats are not empowered to make a separate judgments as to consensus and to refuse to flag, or to withdraw a flag by virtue of having the technical ability to do so. 
 When bots are approved, they are listed at   and the next bureaucrat to check that list will assign the flag. Once a bot is listed, bureaucrats rely on the approval decision of BAG.
 
 
In one   case, I did decline to flag a bot  . This was expressly because I judged   to have been only partial - Tawker had only endorsed the technical merits of the bot. It was later decided this bot would run unflagged. Simply put, I propose that page moves of pages in the "" :"" namespace be restricted to administrators. In other words, I think that the entire namespace should be  . There is one major reason why I think this is necessary, should have been done long ago, and why I don't believe that even   should be allowed to move the pages in that namespace. The reason is: when a page gets moved from a title in the ""Module:"" namespace, it   leaves a redirect. This situation is problematic since, for one, it is the equivalent of having access to the ""delete"" function while not being an administrator and, for two, if there are any pages that run the module by its previous name (such as pages in the ""Template:"" namespace), they all break after the move (and since there are no redirects in the ""Module:"" namespace, there is   to avoid the pages that run the modules from temporarily going down after the page move.)

 Ahmed has already been invited to the headquarters of some of the biggest internet giants out there. I was thinking that wikimedia should make a similar gesture of support and encouragement.

 I see this all over Wikipedia, all the time, especially in the opening sentences of articles about (Jewish) Israeli people. The article will start ""  (born Y date) is an   so-and-so ...""—with the word ""Israeli"" linking to the article  . This rather pervasive practice is at the very least   linking and, in my opinion, frankly racist. It's as if white American people had their articles opening ""  (born Y date) is an   so-and-so ..."", with a link to   under the word ""American"". I have removed at least a couple dozen of these usages by hand as I've come across them over the last month or so, but since the number of them seems to be so high (and people with a certain agenda seem to re-add these links occasionally), I think a bot would be advisable to change the wikicode   to just  , without a link. I have no experience in these things so I am listing this here. Any assistance would be appreciated. Cheers, —  09:49, 14 September 2015 (UTC)

 Please have your discussion somewhere else ( ). This is supposed to be a page where bot operators can work with people who have a request that has already been discussed or is uncontroversial. Having an RfC here will drown out the useful noise.   ( ) 15:55, 15 September 2015 (UTC) 
  please excuse the thread of conversation being moved and broken up slightly. I agree with you that ideally Israelis of all backgrounds would be introduced simply as Israeli, without a wikilink, but I think so far as a bot is concerned it is better to focus on the low-hanging fruit of the   problem first. The rest is another, much longer and much more complicated, discussion. —  19:07, 15 September 2015 (UTC)

 The reason for this action is  . If we are truly concerned with readers' privacy as they enter Wikipedia, we should be equally concerned with it as they follow an external link that serves as a reference to what they just read. The issue concerns all existing external links to Google services ( ,  ,  , etc.) and the Internet Archive domain ( ), and   those two, because Google Books, Google News and the Internet Archive's   are among the most linked-to references on Wikipedia, with literally millions of external links.

    —   17:00, 15 September 2015 (UTC) This RfC completely missed the fact that locations that use proxy servers will break secure links since they would end-up proxying the secure link but will not have the certificate. Bad idea.   ( ) 04:13, 17 October 2015 (UTC) 
 If it is true that this change will make life much more difficult for readers suffering under oppressive regimes and that need to use proxy servers to circumvent oppression, then this is sufficient reason not to make such a change - however many coddled westerners 'vote' for such a change.

 I just want to add a technical opinion. By retrieving the http version and then the https version one can compare if they are the same and then (automatically) change the url protocol. And if the page is loaded any way there's an opportunity to check sum the page while at it and include in the reference. Anyone not able to get to https links can change the protocol manually.

 The following discussion is closed.   Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page. No further edits should be made to this discussion.
 Over the last few months, we slowly expanded the availability of VisualEditor as an option for new editors. This is  , which means that all accounts registered from now on get the choice to use VisualEditor.
 Though VisualEditor is useful to both experienced and new users alike, we are yet to offer any choice to existing, inexperienced users. People with an existing account can and do opt-in to use VisualEditor, and there are a number of experienced editors (like those who read this page) who choose to use it. However, the vast majority of people are casual, irregular editors who come back every few months or so (or never). They do not change any of their settings, and most of them likely don’t even know they can. Offering VisualEditor to them as merely an opt-in preference is hiding it away.
 Consequently, I think we should make VisualEditor available to all existing, inexperienced accounts, and for dormant accounts. By this I mean those who have not yet made many edits (fewer than 1000), and those who haven’t edited at all for a while (perhaps three to six months).  , as many of you have made the decision to not use VisualEditor, which I respect. This change would also not provide VisualEditor to anonymous editors, who I think deserve a separate community conversation about how that can take place, at some point in the future.
 The location of the preference switch will be moving soon to the ""Editing section of  .  This will bring the English Wikipedia into line with the majority of other Wikipedias, like French, Russian, or Italian; see   for what that will look like. This will not mean that VisualEditor is ""complete"" or that it is out of ""beta"" though – there are still lots of improvements yet to make, not least integrating wikitext and visual editing together properly and removing the hack of having a second edit tab that jumbles up the interface. I have no intention of forcing anyone to use VisualEditor.
 The choices about whether, at which thresholds, and exactly when to do this, are up for a discussion, and I would appreciate suggestions. I think this change would be a reasonable change without disrupting things for most users. Thoughts?

 My main reason for thinking that these references may be of use for readers is the prevalence of false accounts.  This addition would better enable readers to find official and verified accounts.  
 The blank template for such a parameter might present something on the lines of:
 | Social media            =  <!-- Due to the prevalence of fake accounts associated to notable people and organisations, all entries must be verified.  Use main platforms used preferably using format: [[https://example reference|name of platform]] or, in cases where facility is available -->
 Should editors agree to the development of further templates we might also add information on the use of contents such as {{facebook|/example}} {{twitter|/example}} {{youtube|/channel/example}} etc.
 These later formats may be of use   at some time in the future, a decision is taken to replace platform names with platform logos/symbols.

 Dear Wikimedia colleagues:
 I am developing a proposal for a video series that's designed to introduce Wikimedia to new contributors (particularly in GLAM and education programs), and to motivate them to participate in the community in a constructive way. I would appreciate your input. The video is intended for translation into multiple languages; there are already volunteers for Spanish, German and Greek translation.
 The proposal's main draft page is  .
 The proposal talk page is  ; it includes a draft outline of specific subjects that the video may cover.
 Please note that the scope and budget of the project are still under consideration. At this point it would be especially helpful to have input on the subjects that the video should cover, and how best to cover them. This information will help as the project scope and budget are refined.
 Please add your questions and comments to the talk page.
 If you would like to support the project with your endorsement, please do so  
 If you would like to volunteer to translate the video, please email me or comment on the talk page.
 Thanks and regards,

 Please make a global change in how Wikipedia refers to the Catholic Church.
 Currently, moderators use the term ""Roman Catholic Church"", which is NOT how Catholics overwhelmingly refer to themselves.
 Since the Catholic Church is comprised of 24 rites, only ONE of which is the Roman Rite, to refer to the whole as the ""Roman Catholic Church"" is entirely inappropriate and insulting to the other rites.
Yes, the Church is 'headquartered' in the Vatican, which in Rome, but that does not justify labeling it as such. No one refers to the LDS church as the ""Salt Lake City Church of Latter Day Saints"".
 ""Roman"" is at best an out-dated, archaic term. At worst, it is a subtle political label meant to qualify the Church as but one Catholic church among many (e.g. the Anglican Church).
The insistence on denominating the Church as ""Roman"" seems to indicate a deep anti-Catholic, Protestant bias within Wikipedia. Anti-Catholic Protestants for centuries have insisted on denigrating the Catholic Church as merely ""Roman"". Terms such as ""the Roman Church"" and ""Romanism"" were used to smear the Church and cast it as foreign and particular, rather than universal. Since in the Apostles' Creed and Nicene Creed many profess belief in ""one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church"" - many Protestants insisted on referring to the Catholic Church as simply the Roman Church. There is also an historical confusion with the Holy Roman Empire, which was a political kingdom unrelated to the Church.
 Since there is no ""official"" name of the Church (it is simply the Church!), we must rely on common usage. Both historically and around the globe, the overwhelming usage of Catholics is to refer to the Church as the Catholic Church. Please update Wikipedia's terminology to reflect both fact and common usage as well as self-identified consensus. 
 Sincerely,
 mnewhous
 Now that we have size options, including newest ""400px"" option, for image display, we should respect people's image preferences per  .

 We have accomplished the task of creating a visual, scrolling timeline of every Wikipedia article. Of course, not every article is historical in nature. Of the 5,000,000 English Wikipedia articles, our estimates are that around 250,000 could use a decent visual, contemporaneous presentation. That is a lot of timelines. We believe it would be one of the most exciting things to happen to history, on the internet, in a long time.
 We have put a (mind blowing) demo together at:
 
 In regards to potentially placing timelines on select Wikipedia articles. It would be just 1 small SCRIPT tag and 1 small DIV tag, per Wikipedia article.
 It is surprisingly simple to do now. 
 All I am asking for is a Wikipedia server to install this on. Wikipedia would, of course, have complete authentication authority over this server. This will take less than one day to do.
 OR:
 I could give Wikipedia.org authentication authority over my ""Amazon Web Services"" server and Wikipedia would give me permission to use it (I will even pay for it).
 Then we can test it on 1 Wikipedia.org article and see what happens.
 We cannot believe how well this turned out. We can't stop timelining Wikipedia articles, it is so compelling and fun.
 I forgot to mention. This whole thing is NEW. Nobody has ever seen this as of today (making timelines out of Wikipedia articles). We have only shown this technology to like 3 other people.

 Yes, I would like to get the data from wherever Wikipedia is getting it. If we could get this to run on the same rackspace as the core of Wikipedia. That would be super-fast. And it would be very inexpensive, not taking any TCP/IP resources. Could I get the data in HTML? I am not sure if you guys take your Wiki language and immediately parse out the HTML on an article edit/save. My widget is pretty straight forward. It is aware of what page it is on. So if we placed the widget on:
  
 And the widget was on a LAN at Wikipedia, this could be translated as:
 c:\wikidata\articles\Queen_Victoria\index.htm
 
Or what ever it is there and serve it out to the user. The key to me is to parse out the current version of the article. So the timeline will exactly match the article every single time. All I need to do is pull the article (locally) and pull the paragraphs out of the article. If I can pull the article in milliseconds, it would be super fast. The slowest part would be serving up the javascript to the widget on the users page. So all I would need is a big outbound pipe.
 And I really don't need a lot of diskspace. My biggest worry, in processing millions of timelines a day is deletion of temporary files and releasing that diskspace back to the operating system. Each request for a timeline will produce 5 or so temporary files (SQL output). But those will be deleted within milliseconds after processing. We just have to make sure they are getting deleted. I can set the location of the temporary file location, so we can monitor this.
 I may be able to write the system to work with no disk writes (convert all the tables to memory arrays), but that would be a LOT of work. That would be a multi week thing, for sure. So we should leave it the way it is now and see if it ramps up well.
 Just my professional assessment, your experience may be different.
 Thanks

 David =  ,
 One more thing. Of course we don't want a timeline loading up on a historical Wikipedia article, every time it is accessed. What we really like is the ""collapseButton"" span tags, usually at the bottom of substantial articles. They are very classy. All we would have to do is add a ""collapseButton"" to the Queen Victoria page and put my SCRIPT tag and DIV tag in there. So when you opened up the ""collapseButton"" the widget JavaScript would be fired off and populate this area with the timeline HTML and JavaScript.
 And if we could get my brilliant   to fire at that point it would be all ""no worries"" after that.
 Of course, the problem with this is the ""collapseButton"" controls are way at the bottom of the Wikipedia pages. I mean WAY down at the bottom. Below the Citations. And that is not good for ""our team"". Then again, timelines in Wikipedia may be so compelling that everybody might know where they are, by word of mouth, within a short time.
 Thanks

 Yes   not much has happened. Rome wasn't built in a day. All we are requesting is 1 computer to display 1 timeline on 1 Wikipedia article. And then we might see where this goes. We have a 6 month period of time chunked out right now where we can focus on this. From 15 October 2015 to 15 March 2015, possibly 8 hours a day or 1000 hours (if not total hours of work, but our undivided attention and full measure of our devotion). I can't guarantee resources like this will be available after that. I think timelines would be much better understood if we could place a timeline on 10 Wikipedia pages. Then we could debate this content and then possibly take a consensus vote on inclusion. Some articles make better timelines than others and consensus would dictate inclusion in any article.
 All we need is 1 server that ""The Foundation"" has administrative privileges/authentication on, whether that is a server we pay for or not. That is not a very big first step.
 We are also going to write a grant application for this and related endeavors (also within the scope of the 1000 hours mentioned above). Any help with this would also be greatly appreciated. So anybody who knows of any organizations issuing grants for ""Comparative History"" or history in general, give us a heads up on that.

 When you attempt to create a description page here for an image that's on Commons, you're presented with the message from  , basically a little warning of ""This image is on Commons, so please don't create this page"", and a link to the Commons URL is provided.  See   for an example of this message in use.  I went to WP:HD asking how to change the URL.  Right now, when you go to   and try to edit its page, the URL in the message is  , while I was planning to edit the MediaWiki page so that it instead went to  , the edit page instead of the description page.    gave me the code, but he also opposed the idea, so I'm not going to make the change without chatting here first.
  Change the URL in the MediaWiki page so that it sends you directly to the screen to edit the Commons description page, rather than sending you to the page itself.  My rationale was ""it seems reasonable that the typical person editing the page was intending to edit the Commons page, so it will save a step by sending them directly to the edit page instead of making them detour through the description page.""

en.wikipedia.org,Kardecist spiritism - Wikipedia,"or   is a   and   doctrine established in   in the mid-19th century by writer and educator Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail (a.k.a.  ). Kardec considered his doctrine to derive from a   perspective.  He described a cycle by which a spirit supposedly returns to material existence after the death of the old body in which it dwelled, as well as the evolution it undergoes during this process.  Kardecism emerged as a   in tandem with spiritualism, the notions and practices associated with spiritual communication disseminated throughout   and   since the 1850s. 
 Kardec coined the term   in 1857  and defined it as ""the doctrine founded on the existence, manifestations, and teachings of spirits"". Kardec claimed that spiritism combines scientific, philosophical, and religious aspects  of the tangible universe and what he described as the universe beyond transcendence.  After observing  , a kind of seance, he was intrigued that the tables seemed to move despite lacking muscles and that they tables seemed to provide answers without having a brain, the spiritualist claims being ""It is not the table that thinks! It is us, the souls of the men who have lived on Earth.""  Kardec also focused his attention on a variety of other   claims such as ""incorporation"" and mediumship. 
 Kardecist doctrine is based on five basic works, known as the  , published between 1857 and 1868. The codification consists of  ,  ,  ,  , and  . Additionally, there are the so-called complementary works, such as  ,  , and  . Its followers consider spiritism a doctrine focused on the moral improvement of humanity and believe in the existence of a single God, the possibility of useful communication with spirits through mediums, and reincarnation as a process of spiritual growth and divine justice. 
 According to the International Spiritist Council, spiritism is present in 36 countries, with over 13 million followers,  being most widespread in  , where it has approximately 3.8 million followers, according to the data from the  , and over 30 million sympathizers, according to the  .  Spiritists are also known for influencing and promoting a movement of social assistance and philanthropy.  The doctrine has had a strong influence on various other religious currents, such as  ,  , and the  . 
 The term   was created by the French educator   (known as Allan Kardec) to specifically name the body of ideas systematized by him in   (1857). 
 To designate new things, new terms are needed. This is required by the clarity of language in order to avoid the confusion inherent in the variety of meanings of the same words. The words spiritual, spiritualist, spiritualism have a well-defined meaning. To give them another meaning, to apply them to the doctrine of Spirits, would be to multiply the already numerous causes of  . (...) Whoever believes to have something within themselves beyond matter, is a spiritualist. However, it does not follow that they believe in the existence of Spirits or in their communications with the visible world. Instead of using the words spiritual, spiritualism, we employ, to indicate the belief we have just referred to, the terms Spiritist and Spiritism, whose form recalls the origin and the radical sense and which, for that reason, have the advantage of being perfectly intelligible, leaving to the word   its own meaning. However, the use of the term, whose root is common to various Western nations of Latin origin or Anglo-Saxon, quickly led to its incorporation into everyday usage to designate everything related to the alleged communication with spirits. Thus, today the term   refers to various religious and philosophical doctrines that assert the survival of spirits after the death of the body, and primarily in the possibility of communicating with them, either casually or deliberately, through evocations or spontaneously.
 The term   is repudiated by some followers of the doctrine who reserve the word   solely for the doctrine as codified by Kardec, affirming that there are no different branches within  , and they refer to believers of various currents as  . These followers believe that spiritism, as a doctrinal body, is singular, making the use of the term   redundant. Thus, those who adhere to the teachings codified by Kardec in the basic works (with varying degrees of tolerance for concepts that are not strictly doctrinal, such as  ) simply identify themselves as  , without the addition of  . The works themselves disapprove of the use of other expressions like  , stating that the codified teachings, in their essence, are not linked to the unique figure of a man, as is the case with   or  , but rather to a collective of spirits whom they believe manifested themselves through various   at that historical moment and were expected to continue communicating, thus keeping the doctrinal body in a constant evolutionary process. However, another portion of followers considers the use of the term   appropriate.
 These expressions emerged from the need of some to distinguish spiritism (as originally defined by Kardec) from   religions such as  . The latter, discriminated against and persecuted at various times in Brazilian history, began to identify themselves as spiritists (at one point with the support of the  ), in an effort to legitimize and consolidate the religious movement, due to the existing proximity between certain concepts and practices of it and Kardec's spiritism.
 Alexander Moreira de Almeida still attempts this legitimation,  even calling Kardec's approach ""revolutionary.""  However, the current scientific consensus considers   a  ,  disregarding the alleged paranormal phenomena that underpin spiritism, such as mediumship, reincarnation,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  . Critics of pseudoscience even define parapsychology as a ""perversion"", as parapsychologists claim that science cannot be the only privileged field that is exempt from the explanations they defend.    (mesmerism) is also present in spiritist teachings, with constant references to mesmeric concepts such as magnetic fluids.  According to this hypothesis, some people could perform healings through ""fluids"". However, the animal magnetism hypothesis is considered pseudoscientific, as scientists have known since the second half of the 18th century that the alleged healings were purely psychosomatic, achieved through  , without any involvement of ""fluids"" or animal magnetism. 
 According to  , citing the claims of   about scientists confirming the alleged spiritual phenomena for 30 years, the mediums deceived the researchers. He considers that these deceptions led to the arrogant language of spiritualist literature. 
 An article published in the British skeptical magazine   also criticizes Spiritism for its association with  , parapsychology, animal magnetism, and other pseudosciences. 
 Kardec taught that ""the teaching of the Spirits is eminently Christian.""  In  , it is stated that Spiritism is ""the only truly Christian tradition."" Spiritist writers such as José Reis Chaves and Severino Celestino da Silva also claim that reincarnation was part of early Christianity until it was condemned by the  .  This controversial thesis was popularized even earlier by Leslie Weatherhead but has also been questioned based on statements from the Church Fathers and the lack of references to reincarnation during that Council.  Agnostic scholar   claims that evidence that early Christians believed in reincarnation is scant.  Christian theologian   claims that there is no evidence of reincarnation in the Bible. According to him, the famous text in John 9:2–3 reflects the rabbinic belief in prenatal sins, according to which a fetus could commit sin before birth, but not at reincarnation. He also dismisses other texts generally cited in support of reincarnation. 
 The qualification of Spiritism itself as Christian has also generated controversy. Dr. Antônio Flávio Pierucci, professor at the Department of Sociology at the   (USP) and scholar of Brazilian religiosity, is one of those who affirm that Spiritism is ""not a Christian religion.""  There are no historical Christian doctrines within Spiritism, present in its main branches, such as the  , the  , the inspiration of the  , and redemption. Due to these differences, many scholars consider it a form of neo-Christianity.  However, Spiritist writers argue that Spiritism is Christian because it promotes the teaching of loving one's neighbor. 
 According to followers and sympathizers of Spiritist doctrine, mediumistic phenomena is universal and has always existed, including abundant accounts in the Bible.  Among others, Spiritists cite biblical mediumistic examples, such as Moses' prohibition of ""consulting the dead"", which would be evidence of the Jewish belief in this possibility, since something unrealizable is not prohibited;  the consultation of  , the first king of the ancient Kingdom of Israel, with the  , in 1 Samuel 28, who sees and hears the disembodied spirit of  , the last of the judges of Israel and the first of the prophets recorded in the history of his people; and the communication of   with   and   on Mount Tabor in the   ( ). 
 Ancient philosophy also provides examples: in  , he speaks about the daimon or genius that accompanied  . 
 Many Spiritists adopt March 31, 1848 (the beginning of the mediumistic events at the residence of the   in Hydesville, US) as the initial milestone of modern mediumistic manifestations, allegedly more ostensive and frequent than ever before, which led many researchers to delve into such phenomena. 
 During the 19th century, there was a great wave of manifestations of mediumship in the United States and Europe.  These manifestations consisted mainly of strange noises, knocks on furniture, and objects that moved or floated without any apparent cause, as in the case of "" "". The supposed case of the Fox sisters in the United States stood out in the late 1840s. 
 The true Spiritist is not the one who believes in the manifestations, but the one who benefits from the teachings given by the Spirits. Belief is of no use if it does not make one take a step forward on the path of progress and make one better towards their neighbor. Regarding his background, Kardec was a disciple of   and a member of various academic societies.  His main intention as a Spiritist was to provide some support to human spirituality at a time when science was advancing rapidly and religions were losing more and more followers. Kardec believed he had found a new way of thinking about reality that would bring together, in a balanced way, the rising science and the declining religion. He analyzed accounts of numerous mediumistic occurrences spread throughout Europe and the United States, unifying the information he interpreted in order to codify this type of practice and the teachings transmitted. 
 Let us prove to them that, thanks to the teachings of those they call demons, we understand the sublime morality of the Gospel, which is summed up in the love of God and our fellow men, and in universal charity. Let us embrace all of humanity, without distinction of worship, race, origin, and, even more so, family, wealth, and social status. Let them know that our God, the God of the Spiritists, is not a cruel and vengeful tyrant who punishes a moment of folly with eternal torments, but a good and merciful father who watches over his wayward children with constant solicitude, seeking to draw them to himself through a series of tests designed to cleanse them of all impurities. The first manifestations of table-turning observed by Kardec involved tables lifting and knocking, using one of their legs, a determined number of knocks to respond   or   as agreed upon, to a proposed question. 
 Despite the belief that supposed   or   were moving the tables,  's scientific experiments published in 1853 showed that the movements were caused by the   and dismissed paranormal explanations for the phenomenon of table-turning.  The ideomotor effect also causes the movements observed in the so-called   and the ""cup game"",  in which participants involuntarily move markers over letters and numbers and also attribute the movements to supposed   or  . 
 Analyzing these phenomena, Kardec concluded that there was nothing convincing about this method for skeptics because they could believe in an effect of electricity, whose properties were little known to the science of that time. Methods were then used to obtain more elaborate responses through the letters of the alphabet: the table knocking a certain number of times would correspond to the sequential number of each letter, thus forming words and sentences in response to the proposed questions.  Kardec concluded that the precision of the answers and their correlation with the questions could not be attributed to chance.  He also questioned the possibility of a muscular hypothesis (such as the ideomotor effect) being the cause of all the alleged movements and messages of the table-turning or other mechanical productions.  The mysterious being who responded in this way, when questioned about its nature, declared that it was a   or  , gave its name, and provided various information about itself. Eventually, the phenomenon decreased in popularity and became anecdotal. 
 , during his exile on the island of Jersey (1851–1855), participated in numerous table-turning sessions with his friend Auguste Vacquerie and came to believe that he had made contact with deceased spirits, including his daughter Léopoldine (who had died by drowning) and great writers such as  ,  ,  , and  .  Faced with experiences with table-turning, Hugo converted to spiritualism, and in 1867 called for science to pay attention to and take seriously the phenomena of table-turning:
 The table that turns or speaks has been greatly ridiculed. Let us speak plainly. This mockery is unjustifiable. To replace examination with contempt is convenient but unscientific. We believe that the elementary duty of Science is to verify all phenomena because if Science ignores them, it has no right to laugh at them. A wise person who laughs at what is possible is very close to being an idiot. Let us be reverent before the possible, whose limits no one knows; let us be attentive and serious in the presence of the superhuman, from which we come and to which we are heading. Founded on April 18, 1857, with the publication of  , Spiritism was structured based on alleged dialogues established with disembodied spirits that, by manifesting through mediums, expounded on scientific, religious, and philosophical topics from the perspective of Christian morality, that is, with the principle of love for one's neighbor, bringing to light new perspectives on various subjects of great philosophical and theological relevance. Thus, one of the basic precepts of Spiritism was established, which is the importance of charity, (Motto:  ),  understood as benevolence towards all, indulgence towards the imperfections of others, and forgiveness of offenses. 
 The Spiritist doctrine aims to establish a dialogue between science, philosophy, and religion, with the goal of obtaining an original form that is both more comprehensive and profound, in order to better understand reality.  Kardec synthesizes the concept with the famous phrase: ""Unshakable faith is only the one that can confront reason face to face in all epochs of humanity."" 
 According to the Spiritist philosopher Herculano Pires, ""Spiritist Philosophy, as Kardec said, generically belongs to what we usually call Spiritualist Philosophy because its view of the Universe is not limited to Matter but extends to Spirit, which it considers as the cause of everything we perceive in the material plane. Embracing in its cosmological interpretation Spiritist Science and resulting in Spiritist Religion, Spiritist Philosophy encompasses the entire doctrine."" 
 The Spiritist doctrine, in general, is based on the following points (principles): 
 Additionally, secondary characteristics can be mentioned: 
 Spiritism does not have an official symbol and prioritizes a denotative language. However, the vine branch depicted in   – the only engraving used by Kardec in the Spiritist Codification – is considered by the doctrine as the perfect metaphorical image of the relationship between the spirit and the human body, due to this passage: 
 Below are some of the main works published by Allan Kardec: 
 The work   was published in 1857 and contains the fundamental principles of Spiritist Doctrine.   , or  , was published in 1861 and discusses the experimental and investigative nature of Spiritism, seen as a theoretical and methodological tool to understand a ""new order of phenomena"" that had never been considered by scientific knowledge: the so-called spiritist or mediumistic phenomena, which were believed to be caused by the intervention of spirits in physical reality. 
 The book  , published in 1864, evaluates the canonical gospels from the perspective of Spiritist Doctrine, addressing the application of Christian moral principles and religious matters such as the practice of worship, prayer, and charity with special attention. 
 The work  , or  , was published in 1865 and consists of two parts: in the first part, Kardec critically examines philosophical contradictions and inconsistencies with scientific knowledge, which he believes can be overcome through Spiritist paradigm of reasoned faith.  Topics covered include: causes of the fear of death, why Spiritists do not fear death, heaven, the Christian hell imitated from the pagan one, limbo, purgatory, doctrine of eternal punishments, penal code of the afterlife, angels, the origin of the belief in demons.  The second part contains dozens of dialogues that purportedly took place between Kardec and various spirits, in which they recount their impressions from the afterlife. 
 The book  , published in 1868, addresses various philosophical and scientific questions, such as the creation of the universe, the formation of worlds, the emergence of the spirit, and the nature of so-called miracles, according to the Spiritist paradigm of understanding reality. 
 The book  , published in 1859, serves as an introductory and didactic work on Spiritism. 
 The periodical   (in Portuguese,  ), dedicated exclusively to Spiritism-related topics, was founded by Kardec and directed by him until his death in 1869. It has had the participation of several prominent figures in the doctrine and is currently published quarterly. 
 The work  , published posthumously in January 1890 by the directors of the Parisian Society of Spiritist Studies, is a compilation of unpublished writings by Kardec, with annotations about the behind-the-scenes of the creation of the doctrine, aiding its understanding. 
 The scientific investigation of the facts and causes of alleged mediumistic phenomena is the subject of intense study, mainly within the pseudoscience  of parapsychology. Scientific investigations on mediumship and other ""spiritual phenomena"" advocated by Spiritism have taken place/take place even within the academic setting, but although many scientists, including renowned ones, have claimed to have provided evidence for the existence of such phenomena in their research through the  , the existence of spirits is neither established nor proven.
 Mediumship has been studied by scientists and scholars for more than a century. 
 Many scientists and intellectuals have dedicated themselves to investigations of mediumship and its implications for the  , including: Kardec,  , Alexandre Aksakof,  ,  ,  , Cesare Lombroso,  ,  ,  , Hans Eysenck,  ,  ,  ,  , James H. Hyslop,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and William McDougall. 
 The  ,  ,  , and   have sections dedicated to religion and spirituality. 
 The relationship between Spiritism itself and medicine is profound, as evidenced by its presence in many spiritist books and the existence of the International Spiritist Medical Association, which brings together medical-spiritist associations from various countries. Spiritism constitutes a vast international movement of charity and healthcare institutions, as evidenced mainly by the existence of such associations, numerous hospitals and spiritist centers, and a notable promotion of   and  .
 Dr. Adolfo Bezerra de Menezes, a spiritist and physician, wrote the classic book   (Insanity from a New Perspective), seeking to relate the issue of mental disorders to Spiritism and promote the application of more effective treatment methods in the field of mental health. 
 Currently, psychiatrist and parapsychologist Alexander Moreira-Almeida, coordinator of the ""Section on Spirituality, Religiosity, and Psychiatry"" of the World Psychiatric Association, is one of the leading figures in the scientific study of the relationship between health and spiritual experiences, especially mediumship.
 There is no consensus among Spiritists as to whether Spiritism is a religion or not, despite the doctrine being classified as a religion in demographic surveys. This is due to the triple aspect of Spiritism, which allows it to be classified as a doctrine that aligns ""science-philosophy-religion"".  In the preamble of the book   (What is Spiritism?), Kardec states that ""Spiritism is, at the same time, a science of observation and a philosophical doctrine. As a practical science, it consists of the relations established between us and the Spirits; as a philosophy, it encompasses all the moral consequences that emanate from these same relations."" Some still contest the religious aspect of Spiritism; however, in the book published by its codifier, titled   (Spiritism in its simplest expression),  he clearly asserts: ""From a religious point of view, Spiritism is based on the fundamental truths of all religions: God, the soul, immortality, rewards and punishments in the afterlife, but it is independent of any particular cult. Its goal is to prove to those who deny or doubt that the soul exists, that it survives the body, and that it experiences, after death, the consequences of the good and evil deeds committed during corporeal life: the goal of all religions.""  Kardec also clarifies that Spiritism is a religion in the Opening Address of the Annual Commemorative Session of the Day of the Dead (Society of Paris, November 1, 1868), where he states:
 If that is the case, you may ask, is Spiritism a religion? Well, yes, undoubtedly, gentlemen! In the philosophical sense, Spiritism is a religion, and we take pride in it because it is the doctrine that establishes the bonds of fraternity and communion of thoughts, not on a mere convention, but on more solid foundations: the very laws of Nature. At the International Spiritist Congress held in Paris in 1925, there was a proposal to remove the religious aspect from Spiritism, but the important French Spiritist philosopher   opposed it with tenacity, even in his already weak physical condition of health.  According to Denis, Spiritism was not the ""religion of the future"" but rather the ""future of religions"". 
 On the other hand, the Spiritist Doctrine affirms respect for all religions and doctrines, values all efforts for the practice of good, and claims to work for fraternity and peace among all peoples and all men,  although it firmly rejects, it must be reiterated, fundamental dogmas of other monotheistic religions. In the case of Christianity, the fundamental dogmas that stand out are the divinity of Christ, the Holy Trinity, salvation or justification by grace (more than by individual works or efforts), and the existence and importance of the Church as a spiritual entity, not just human. 
 The Spiritist doctrine adopts Christian morality  despite its differentiated theological conceptions. According to Spiritists, the name given to the followers of Spiritism, Jesus Christ is the most elevated spirit to have ever incarnated on Earth. 
 Spiritists (a widely used translation during the early decades of the 20th century for the French neologism  ) or Spiritists consider themselves Christians and attribute to Spiritist doctrine the character of a Christian doctrine since they consider themselves followers of the moral teachings of Jesus. Spiritists base their defense of the Christian character of Spiritist doctrine on the fact that Allan Kardec argued that Christian morality, free from the dogmas of faith associated with it, would be the closest thing to a divine and rational code of ethics that humans possess. Spiritists argue that the dogmas were elaborated over the centuries by the Catholic Church and therefore it is not necessary to follow them to be a Christian. Furthermore, item 625 of   states that Jesus is the greatest moral example available to humanity, although Spiritism denies any genuinely divine nature to him. 
 The   are nine teachings that Jesus delivered in the  , according to the New Testament ( ). For Spiritism, these teachings are of great importance, and they will now be presented from the Spiritist perspective.
 . According to Spiritism, Jesus promises the kingdom of heaven to the simple and humble, referring to the moral qualities of the individual. 
 . According to Spiritism, only in the afterlife can the compensations that Jesus promises to the afflicted on Earth be fulfilled. Faith in the future can console and instill patience in the spirit that endures the various terrestrial anomalies with calmness and resignation. However, it does not justify the causes of the diversity of evils, inequalities between vice and virtue, deformities, and natural disasters. The vicissitudes of life can be divided into two parts according to the Spiritist perspective: some have their explanations in the present life, while others are found outside of this life. This latter cause, in the Spiritist view, is explained by the plurality of existences in which the incarnated spirit pays for the evils it has committed in previous lives. 
 The purity of the heart resembles the principle of simplicity and humility, excluding all ideas of pride and selfishness. According to Spiritism, the emblem of purity that Jesus takes in relation to children should not be taken literally, ""  (Mark 10:13-15). The spirit of the child, not yet able to manifest its tendencies towards evil, represents momentarily the image of innocence and purity resembling pure spirits. However, the actions [good or bad] taken by the spirit before incarnating gradually reflect in its behavior as an incarnated spirit. Therefore, as the incarnated spirit develops its physical structure, it also develops its psychic structure, which exhibits behavioral characteristics corresponding to the real conduct of the spirit itself. 
 . According to Spiritism, Jesus makes meekness, moderation, gentleness, affability, and patience a law. 
 Mercy consists of forgiving offenses, and for Spiritism, the sacrifice that pleases God the most is reconciliation with adversaries, as stated in Matthew 5:23-24. 
 According to Spiritism, all Christian morality is summarized in this axiom:
 The   is a public utility entity  founded on January 2, 1884, in Rio de Janeiro. It is a civil, religious, educational, cultural, and philanthropic society whose purpose is the study, practice, and dissemination of Spiritism in all its aspects, based on the works of Allan Kardec's   and the canonical Gospels. 
 The   (ISC) is an organization resulting from the union of representative associations of national Spiritist movements and currently has 35 associated countries. It was constituted on November 28, 1992, in Madrid, Spain. Its objectives are the promotion of fraternal union among Spiritist institutions in all countries and the unification of the worldwide Spiritist movement; the promotion of the study and dissemination of Spiritist Doctrine in its three basic aspects: scientific, philosophical, and religious; and the promotion of the practice of material and moral charity as taught by Spiritist Doctrine. The main event organized by the ISC is the World Spiritist Congress, held every three years. 
 The  , founded on October 5, 1946, in Argentina, is an international institution that mainly brings together Spiritists from Latin America. CEPA has adherent and affiliated institutions in various countries and defends a   view of Spiritism. The organization takes controversial positions among Spiritists, such as the dissociation between the doctrine and Christianity and the need to update Spiritism in light of science. Since October 13, 2000, the headquarters of CEPA has been in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul. CEPA's activities in Brazil are primarily carried out through events promoted by adherent institutions, such as the Forum of Free Thinking Spiritists and the Brazilian Symposium on Spiritist Thought. 
 From 1857, the year of the release of  , to 1869, the year of Kardec's death, Spiritism gained 7 million followers.  According to data from 2005, Spiritism has about 13 million followers worldwide,  and according to data from 2010,   – the country with the most followers  – has about 3.8 million Spiritists.  The International Spiritist Council (CEI) has 36 member countries.  Another international Spiritist organization, the Pan American Spiritist Confederation, brings together Spiritist institutions and delegates from 13 countries. 
 Spiritism arrived in   in 1865 according to the Brazilian Spiritist Federation (FEB), although there are differing opinions on this matter.  as reported below:
 Although since 1853 the country's newspapers already reported family gatherings for the production of   of  , the Spiritism codified by   only arrived in Brazil around 1860 with the first copies of  . It was in the year 1860 that the first Spiritist book published in Brazil appeared:   (""The Times Have Come""), by French professor Casimir Lieutuad, a pioneering work that paved the way for the introduction of   in Brazil. Through Bezerra de Menezes  and  ,  Spiritism had the opportunity to become popular throughout the country, spreading its teachings across a large part of the Brazilian territory. Brazil is the country with the largest number of Spiritists worldwide.  However, in the 19th century, the penal code of 1890 even banned the practice of Spiritism in Brazil and punished those who practiced the ""crime"" with up to 6 months in prison. Although socially tolerated, especially after the actions of the Brazilian Spiritist Federation (FEB) in the first decades of the 20th century, the practice ceased to be officially prohibited only with the promulgation of the penal code of 1940.  The FEB congregates approximately ten thousand Spiritist institutions,  spread across all regions of the country. There are also several Brazilian Spiritist associations for specific professions, such as the Brazilian Medical-Spiritist Association, Brazilian Association of Spiritist Psychologists, Brazilian Association of Spiritist Judges, Brazilian Association of Spiritist Artists, and Crusade of Spiritist Military. 
 According to the Brazilian Census of 2010, Brazil had about 3.8 million Spiritists.  The state capitals with the highest percentage of Spiritists are   (7.3%),   (7.1%),   (5.9%),   (4.7%),   (4.3%),   (4.0%),   (3.6%),   (3.6%),   (3.5%), and   (3.5%).  The   considers the terms   and   as equivalents in its census classification. 
 As the third-largest religious group in Brazil, Spiritists also have the highest income and education levels among social segments, according to data from the same Census. Spiritists are strongly associated with acts of charity. They maintain  , orphanages, schools for the underprivileged, daycares, and other institutions for assistance and social promotion in all Brazilian states.    is a well-known and respected figure in Brazil.  He is the most read French author in the country, with his books selling more than 25 million copies throughout the Brazilian territory. If we count other Spiritist books, all derived from the works of Kardec, the Brazilian Spiritist publishing market surpasses 4,000 titles already published and over 100 million copies sold.  The Spiritist theme constitutes the most successful literary market in Brazil, with Spiritist books leading the bestseller lists in the country's main bookstores.  According to the 2010 census, Spiritism experienced significant growth from 2000 to 2010, with an increase of over 60% in followers, going from 2.3 million to 3.8 million followers,  with the majority of them being between 50 and 59 years old (3.1%) and having the highest literacy rate (98.6%), the highest percentage of individuals with a completed university education (31.5%), and income above 5 minimum wages (19.7%), as well as the lowest percentage of individuals with no education (1.8%) and with incomplete primary education (15.0%). 
 After the legalization of  , there was a revival of Spiritism, which had been present in the Caribbean country since the 19th century.  According to data from the Ministry of Religions, in 2011, there were 400 Spiritist centers in  , with an additional 200 being registered, making Cuba the second most Spiritist country in the world in terms of the number of centers. The Cuban Medical-Spiritist Association has the highest number of activists in the International Medical-Spiritist Association. 
 In  , one of the great pioneers of Spiritism was  , VIII Marquis of Flórida and X Lord of Algarrobo y Bormujos, who presented a bill for the official teaching of Spiritism, reading it on August 26, 1873. 
 In the decades of 1850–1860, Spiritism reached  , attracting the intellectual elite with its proposals of  ,   reform, and   of free thought. General Refugio Indalecio González translated works by Kardec, publishing   in Spanish in 1872 in Mexico and, under the direction of the Sociedad Espírita Central de la República Mexicana, circulated spiritist magazines.  Among others, there was also the initial dissemination by   Nicolás Pizarro Suárez.  In 1875, attention to Spiritism became heated in   when, in a   reaction after publications in the press, a debate was held between materialist and spiritualist students at the Liceo Hidalgo and Teatro del Conservatorio, considered by Zenia Yébenes Escardó as ""the first philosophical controversy that was considered as such in Mexico.""  In addition to its academic presence, popular Spiritism emerged, incorporating indigenous practices and local cults, with a strongly present folkloric imagery in the figure of  , a spiritual healer who was supported by the spiritist  .  The feminist Laureana Wright, an already renowned writer, converted to Spiritism in 1889 to promote the debate of thought and women's equality, inspired by examples of female emancipation that she observed in other countries, and started holding sessions attended by various public figures, later becoming the president of the Sociedad Espírita Central.  Spiritist groups emerged in various locations, and after a brief decline at the end of the 19th century, attention on Spiritism intensified in the early 20th century through press coverage after  , who promoted it through works he distributed, organized congresses, and, inspired by allegedly psychographed letters, published a book that promoted the  , becoming the president of Mexico for a short period until he was assassinated. 
 Since the 19th century, particularly in France and Brazil, there have been conflicts of opinion among Spiritists, mistakenly referred to as ""Kardecists,"" and the so-called ""Roustainguists,"" regarding the acceptance or rejection of the postulates of the work  , coordinated by Jean-Baptiste Roustaing, especially concerning the genesis of Jesus' body and the spiritual fall, which would cause the first incarnation of the spirits that failed. For Spiritists who accept the Kardec-Roustaing duo, Jesus had a ""fluidic"" body on Earth due to being a pure spirit, and thus, the genesis of that body was by His psychomagnetic will, characterizing Him as an  . 
 On the other hand, Spiritists who do not accept the work  , coordinated by Roustaing, believe that Jesus had a material body like any other incarnated human being, and its genesis was also similar, through the fusion of sperm and ovum. 
 Furthermore, Roustaing's   explains that the spirits who failed due to atheism, pride, and selfishness incarnated in primitive worlds as ""fleshy cryptogams"" (creeping animals resembling slugs), which represents the doctrine of  , not accepted by Spiritism since the doctrine of reincarnation states that the Spirit only reincarnates in the human kingdom (Humanity). 
 In the Brazilian city of Santos, a dissenting movement within the Spiritist movement emerged in 1910, which called itself ""Rational and Scientific Christian Spiritism"" and later became known as Christian rationalism, systematized by   and Luís Alves Tomás. 
 In Brazil, since the second half of the 1950s, some Spiritist centers have followed the doctrine allegedly dictated by the spirit Ramatis (mainly embodied in the works psychographed by Hercílio Maes). They differ from traditional Spiritist centers due to a greater emphasis on universalism (common origin of religions) and the comparative study of Western and Eastern spiritualist religions and philosophies. It is also notable for a stronger influence of Eastern thought currents (such as Buddhism and Hinduism) and its proximity to the cosmogony of universalist  . 
 After ending the partnership with medium Chico Xavier in 1968, medium   began his own research on the phenomenon called ""consciential projection"" (referred to as ""spiritual unfolding"" in Spiritism). Consequently, in 1987, he systematized the parascientific movement called  . 
 Emerging in Brazil as a dissent within the Spiritist movement since September 2002. While still following Spiritist Doctrine, it claims to do so with greater seriousness than the Brazilian movement itself, which is an argument used for its separation. 
 Kardec's introductory book on Spiritism,  , published only two years after  , includes a hypothetical discussion between him and three idealized critics, ""The Critic"", ""The Skeptic"", and ""The Priest"", summing up much of the criticism Spiritism has received. The broad areas of criticism relate to charlatanism, pseudoscience, heresy, witchcraft, and Satanism. Until his death, Kardec addressed these issues in various books and his periodical, the  .
 Later, the  , a competing new religion,  saw the Spiritist explanations as too simple or even naïve. 
 's influential book   criticized both the more general concepts of  , which he considered to be a superficial mix of   and  , as well as Spiritism's specific contributions, such as its belief in what he saw as a  ,   concept of reincarnation distinct from and opposed to its two western predecessors,   and  . 
 The Catechism of the Catholic Church (paragraph 2117) states that ""  often implies divination or magical practices; the Church, for her part, warns the faithful against it"". 
 In  , Catholic priests   and  , among others, have written extensively against Spiritism from both a doctrinal and parapsychological perspective. Quevedo, in particular, has sought to show that Spiritism's claims of being a science are invalid. In addition to writing books on the subject,  he has also hosted television programs debunking supposed paranormal phenomena, most recently in a series that ran in 2000 on  's news program  .   Brazilian Spiritist Hernani Guimarães Andrade has, in turn, written rebuttals to these criticisms.  
 Spiritism has been the subject of various non-literary works, such as soap operas, series, and films. 
 The Brazilian soap opera   (1966), produced by the extinct  , was inspired by the spiritist novel   psychographed by the Russian medium Vera Kryzhanovskaia.  The soap opera   (1975), produced by TV Tupi, was inspired by the spiritist novels   and   psychographed by Chico Xavier, developing a complex plot addressing concepts such as  ,  , spiritual obsession,  , and others. Rede Globo conceived a remake of it in 1994.  The soap opera   (1977), produced by the extinct TV Tupi and also with a   conceived in 2006 by Rede Globo, portrays the main character as a medium capable of predicting the future. 
 More recently, the productions  ,   ,   ,   ,  and   also told stories related to Spiritism. 
 The Brazilian film   (1979) was based on the work   psychographed by   and is the first in the country with a spiritist theme, portraying the   tragedy, which left 179 dead and over 300 injured (February 1, 1974). Several other films followed, such as   (2006, seen by over 500,000 viewers),    (2010, seen by about 3.5 million viewers in theaters),    (also in 2010, seen by over 4 million viewers in theaters),  among others.
 The series   (2001), produced by   and  , addresses paranormal phenomena, near-death experience,  , precognition, and  . The series is based on the novel  , written by  , and the film   directed by  ;   
 The series   (2005), produced by  , features a protagonist who uses her mediumship to assist a public prosecutor in solving crimes. The series is based on the life of the American medium Allison DuBois, primarily on her work  ;  
 The miniseries   (2010), aired and produced by  , portrays the protagonist   as a healing medium performing spiritual surgeries;  
 The series   (2011), produced by  , tells the story of a renowned widowed surgeon who tries to change his personality after interacting with the spirit of his deceased ex-wife.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-Ambox_important.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-Ambox_important.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/LLDE_cep_vigne.jpg/130px-LLDE_cep_vigne.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Home_and_the_accordion_trick.png/220px-Home_and_the_accordion_trick.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Photo_Kardec.jpg/220px-Photo_Kardec.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Tables_Tournantes_-_L%27Illustration%2C_Paris%2C_14_May_1853_%28page_1_crop%29.jpg/250px-Tables_Tournantes_-_L%27Illustration%2C_Paris%2C_14_May_1853_%28page_1_crop%29.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Fronton_AK.JPG/220px-Fronton_AK.JPG|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Evolu%C3%A7%C3%A3o_espiritual.gif/310px-Evolu%C3%A7%C3%A3o_espiritual.gif|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Le_Livre_des_Esprits_2.jpg/170px-Le_Livre_des_Esprits_2.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Qu%27est-ce_que.jpg/170px-Qu%27est-ce_que.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Hopital_spirite_Andr%C3%A9_Luiz.jpg/220px-Hopital_spirite_Andr%C3%A9_Luiz.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Christianismeetspiritisme.jpg/170px-Christianismeetspiritisme.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/La_religion_spirite001.jpg/170px-La_religion_spirite001.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Si%C3%A8ge_f%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_spirite_br%C3%A9silienne.jpg/220px-Si%C3%A8ge_f%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_spirite_br%C3%A9silienne.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Festival_Allan_Kardec_2010_Sao_Paulo_1.jpg/220px-Festival_Allan_Kardec_2010_Sao_Paulo_1.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/I_Congresso_de_Mocidades_Esp%C3%ADritas_do_Brasil_1948.jpg/220px-I_Congresso_de_Mocidades_Esp%C3%ADritas_do_Brasil_1948.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Centre_spirite_Boa_Ventura_Para%C3%ADba.JPG/220px-Centre_spirite_Boa_Ventura_Para%C3%ADba.JPG|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Centro_espirita2.jpg/220px-Centro_espirita2.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Certid%C3%A3o_nascimento_Roustaing.jpg/220px-Certid%C3%A3o_nascimento_Roustaing.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/2006.07.06.cv.sv.Mindelo.CasaRacionalista.JPG/220px-2006.07.06.cv.sv.Mindelo.CasaRacionalista.JPG|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/34px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/16px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardecist_spiritism

en.wikipedia.org,Quibebé - Wikipedia,"( , Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay),   (Paraguay, pronounced the same), or   ( , Brazil) is a popular dish of semi-sweet   stew or purée in  ,   , and the North-Eastern   gastronomies.  It has a doughy texture and is of creamy consistency. Its taste is very pleasant and the primary ingredient is a   fruit that is called by the guarani name, ""andaí"" or ""zapallo anco"" of  . The fruit is a   that may be elongated or spherical, and its exterior color ranges from green to orange, to reddish. The pulp is orange color (a color that in Guarany would be called ""reddish"", the translation of the term Kiveve), compact, of firm texture, and has a sweet flavor. 
 Till the second part of the 19th century, it was very usual in the   and its area of influence.  
 The origin of ""kiveve"" is located in  .
 Traditional ""kiveve"" is made using the following ingredients: a pumpkin or ""andai"" with a deep orange flesh and sweet flavor, cooked and pureed;  , a kind of   with a consistency between   and corn flour ( ), and fresh cheese. It's served mildly warm or already cool in a bowl, each commensal pours in   to taste.
 The pumpkin is peeled, cubed and boiled in water. When cubes are tender enough the preparation is pureed with a blender or smashed in its own cooking liquid in the same pot, then sugar is added, and finally corn flour is sifted all over the bland puree in the pot while stirring the mixture in the fire, keep stirring for about 10 minutes, or until the corn flour is completely cooked. Fresh cheese finely chopped is added, stir again for a few seconds and retrieve the pot from the fire. Kiveve used to be cooked in clay pots. 
 This dish is served as a sweet snack or as a dessert. 
 The name ""kiveve"" comes from the Guaranitical term for a reddish color.  Because the ""andai"", the main ingredient of the dessert, has a deep orange color, it was given the name ""kiveve"" (reddish). In fact, in popular slang, the word, ""kiveve"", is used to identify redheaded people.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Calabaza_kivev%C3%A9.JPG/300px-Calabaza_kivev%C3%A9.JPG|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Cucurbita_maxima_Zapallo_Plomo_semiller%C3%ADa_Costanzi_-_2014_04_02_-_Squash_M_preparing_%22Quibeb%C3%A9%22_1_smashing_cubes_in_the_pot.JPG/200px-Cucurbita_maxima_Zapallo_Plomo_semiller%C3%ADa_Costanzi_-_2014_04_02_-_Squash_M_preparing_%22Quibeb%C3%A9%22_1_smashing_cubes_in_the_pot.JPG|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Cucurbita_maxima_Zapallo_Plomo_semiller%C3%ADa_Costanzi_-_2014_04_02_-_Squash_M_preparing_%22Quibeb%C3%A9%22_2.JPG/200px-Cucurbita_maxima_Zapallo_Plomo_semiller%C3%ADa_Costanzi_-_2014_04_02_-_Squash_M_preparing_%22Quibeb%C3%A9%22_2.JPG|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quibeb%C3%A9

 So, rather than go ahead and kill even more electrons on   with the clearly-excessive 37-step repro I have written up,  is there   way I can convince you to just turn on the gadget (if you have it off), reload your watchlist, and type   into a console?  Not getting 596 in the results anymore despite having dismissed the RFA message is 95% of the proof, and I suppose I could demonstrate the rest over on testwiki if it's kosher to hand out interface-admin there. —  00:38, 6 November 2023 (UTC) 
 If you use {{Special:NewPages|namespace=0|limit=1}} you get this result:
 
If you inspect its classes you'll see that the talk and contribute links are inside a single class called ""mw-usertoollinks"" but article history and edit are not. The parentheses, space and pipe characters are plain text, outside of the classes themselves. Therefore, if you decide to hide them, like I tried  , you'll get left with those characters with no way to target them (JS aside). Is this considered a bug? Can I talk with someone for this to be changed? I can of course just open a phab ticket but not sure how to report the problem in a clear way without using live examples like I did here. -   ( ) 12:55, 6 November 2023 (UTC)

 Sorry, a little late.
 With ""Zebra 1"" the scrolling is OK, i.e. I can scroll down to the bottom.

 Citing you (from  ) that   That's what transfer means to my mind when submitting the question and the possibility of it was what I meant to ask. Thanks for ensuring that this is possible.  Moreover, I asked about that on   because I guessed it's part of Wikipedia policy regarding the transfer possibility. It's not like I was asking if there's a magical button to enable instant transfer that could make me asking about this (possibility of right transfer) on   or  .   ( ) 22:12, 11 January 2024 (UTC) 
 Hey, yeah sorry my talk page is large. I've been waiting on the mediawiki team working on enhancing talk page experience to roll out automated page management which preserved linking to the topic headers. Possibly that is supported now? Seeing now that my talk page can't be saved, I wouldn't mind the help. I still think this should be solved by the Mediawiki configuration and not by ad-hoc user scripts and bots as this is a core function of communication and linking should be preserved. See my previous note   though I'm not opposed to getting some help. I don't have time at the moment to move some of the automated newsletter posts like "" "" and ""  "" to their own subpages and probably the largest offenders for space. I don't link to those posts typically, but do reference them and do link to other conversation on and off wiki. I just don't remember where those newsletters are configured to fix where they post and would love if they linked back to manage that so users can find it easier. Sorry for not managing this, I was hoping it would be fixed by the system updating to something that didn't break links and broadly implement pagination.   ( ) 19:52, 12 January 2024 (UTC)

 Hi,   has been reported at AN/I   and a month ago  , but neither the user or any admin have responded. I think that the user's continuing use of poor sources is a problem and that they should be encouraged to respond to the advice on  . I have added some diffs to the latest report. Do you agree or am I expecting too much from them? I posted here because you were on the list of recently active admins.   ( ) 15:01, 5 February 2024 (UTC)

 Hey Xaos! Can you help me with something UI related?
 In our Albanian village pump we have these ""windows"", called ""Dritare"", which you can check for yourself  , just below the main header. The idea is to have our VP act as a central hub where admins/experienced users can quickly check the main pages of our community through the so-called ""windows"" and interact with them to solve any issues without having to leave the page. This is achieved through section transclusion and it works rather fine on its own. Been using it for quite some months now. I was recently thinking to enhance it by introducing a new feature: ""Non-empty"" windows will have red backgrounds to indicate their backlog status and hopefully draw the attention of interested volunteers. Is there a way you think this can be achieved using only CSS? The problem lies on the ""non-empty"" part because they're never empty per se, having HTML tags and Mediawiki templates in them. I mean ""non-empty"" as in ""not having any sections/issues open"". I'm not sure how to handle targeting in this case or if it is even possible. Maybe that's not achievable using only CSS? -   ( ) 11:55, 8 February 2024 (UTC)

 Hey there! This is to let you know that phase I of the   is now  . Lots of proposals remain open for discussion, and the current round of review looks to be on a good track towards making significant progress towards improving  's structure and environment. I'd like to give my heartfelt thanks to everyone who has given us their idea for change to make RfA better, and the same to everyone who has given the necessary feedback to improve those ideas. The following proposals remain open for discussion:
 To read proposals that were closed as unsuccessful, please see  . You are cordially invited once again to participate in the open discussions; when phase I ends, phase II will review the outcomes of trial proposals and refine the implementation details of other proposals. Another notification will be sent out when this phase begins, likely with the first successful close of a major proposal. Happy editing!   (  • she/her), via:

en.wikipedia.org,Welfare biology - Wikipedia,"is a proposed cross-disciplinary field of research to study the positive and negative well-being of   in relation to their environment.   first advanced the field in 1995. Since then, its establishment has been advocated for by a number of writers, including philosophers, who have argued for the importance of creating the research field, particularly in relation to  . Some researchers have put forward examples of existing research that welfare biology could draw upon and suggested specific applications for the research's findings.
 Welfare biology was first proposed by the    , in his 1995 paper ""Towards welfare biology: Evolutionary economics of animal consciousness and suffering"". In the paper, Ng defines welfare biology as the ""study of living things and their environment with respect to their welfare (defined as net happiness, or enjoyment minus suffering)."" He also distinguishes between ""affective"" and ""non-affective"" sentients, affective sentients being individuals with the capacity for perceiving the external world and experiencing pleasure or pain, while non-affective sentients have the capacity for perception, with no corresponding experience; Ng argues that because the latter experience no pleasure or suffering, ""[t]heir welfare is necessarily zero, just like nonsentients"". He concludes, based on his modelling of evolutionary dynamics, that suffering dominates enjoyment in nature. 
 Matthew Clarke and Ng, in 2006, used Ng's welfare biology framework to analyse the costs, benefits and welfare implications of the   of kangaroos—classified as affective sentients—in  , Australia. They concluded that while their discussion ""may give some support to the culling of kangaroos or other animals in certain circumstances, a more preventive measure may be superior to the resort to culling"".  In the same year, Thomas Eichner and Rüdiger Pethi analyzed Ng's model, raising concern regarding a lack of appropriate determinants of the welfare of organisms because of the infancy of welfare biology. 
 In 2016, Ng argued that welfare biology could help resolve the paradox within  , first raised by  , on the difficulty of studying animal feelings, by answering ""difficult questions regarding animal welfare""; in the paper, Ng also offered various practical proposals for improving the welfare of captive animals.    and Sayma H. Chowdhury, in response to Ng, argued that rather than focusing on improving the welfare of captive animals, that it would be better to not breed them in the first place, as this would ""eliminate their suffering altogether"".  
 Ng published an update to his original 1995 paper, with Zach Groff, in 2019, which found an error in his original model, leading to a negation of the original conclusion and a revised conception of the extent of suffering in nature as less pessimistic. 
 A chapter on welfare biology by the moral philosophers   and   is included in the 2019 book  . In the chapter, they argue that welfare biology could be partially developed from animal welfare science, but its focus would be broader because it wouldn't only focus on studying animals under human control. Faria and Horta also assert that welfare biology could be developed from  , with a focus on how the well-being of sentient individuals is affected by their environments. They raise a concern of what they see as the minimization of the importance of animal well-being, caused by widespread speciesist and environmentalist beliefs among life scientists and the general public, which they argue could hamper the development of welfare biology. Faria and Horta conclude that the ""expected value of developing welfare biology is extremely high"" because of the massive extent of  , which refutes commonly conceived idyllic conceptions of nature. 
 Some researchers have emphasised the importance of   to welfare biology, as they argue certain traits of life history may predispose certain individuals to worse welfare outcomes and that this has a strong relationship with   sensitivity.  It has also been suggested that while welfare biology, as a field in its infancy, lacks sufficient empirical studies on the welfare of wild animals, it can make up for this through the use of existing demographic data, currently used to inform  , to inform future research efforts.  Reviewing the welfare implications of fire on wild animals has been cited as an example of using knowledge drawn from existing ecology studies to establish the field of welfare biology and identify future directions of research.  The application of welfare biology to   projects has additionally been a subject of investigation, with ""collaboration between local people, conservationists, authorities and policymakers"" suggested as a means of establishing welfare biology as a discipline.  
 Researchers in   have drawn attention to Ng's claim in his original paper that the ""time is ripe for the recognition of welfare biology as a valid field of scientific study"", yet after 25 years, welfare biology as a field of research has yet to take off. 
  and   are two organizations working on promoting the establishment of welfare biology as a field of research. 
 Catia Faria and Oscar Horta have proposed urban welfare ecology as a subdiscipline of welfare biology, which would study the well-being of animals living in urban, suburban and industrial ecosystems. They suggest that much research has already been carried out on animals in these areas, but with the intention of eliminating their negative impact on humans, or to conserve animals of particular species. Faria and Horta argue that such knowledge can be applied to help mitigate the harms that these animals experience and that such environments are perfect for intervention experiments because such ecosystems are already greatly under human control and that the findings could be applied to improve the assessments of the well-being of animals in other ecosystems. 
 Some writers in the field of   have argued that there are compelling moral reasons to reduce the suffering of sentient individuals and that following this line of reasoning, humans should undertake interventions to reduce the suffering of wild animals;  they claim that because ecosystems are not sentient, that they consequently lack the capacity to care about  , while arguing that sentient animals do have interests in their welfare.  As a result, they argue that there are strong justifications for ecologists to shift their resources currently used for conservation biology, to welfare biology.  It has also been asserted that if one is to accept an obligation to undertake systematic and large-scale efforts to help wild animals, that this would first require several important questions to be answered and that large-scale actions should only be carried out after a long phase of successful small-scale trials.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Forrester-Kangaroo-mob.jpg/220px-Forrester-Kangaroo-mob.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Feral_pigeon_%28Columba_livia_domestica%29%2C_2017-05-27.jpg/220px-Feral_pigeon_%28Columba_livia_domestica%29%2C_2017-05-27.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/16px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_biology

en.wikipedia.org,Non-cellular life - Wikipedia,", also known as  , is   that exists without a   structure for at least part of its  .  Historically, most   postulated that an   must be composed of one or more cells,  but this is for some no longer considered necessary, and modern criteria allow for forms of life based on other structural arrangements. 
 Viruses were initially described as   or  , then as ""infectious proteins""; but they possess  , a defined structure, and the ability to spontaneously assemble from their constituent parts. This has spurred extensive debate as to whether they should be regarded as fundamentally organic or inorganic — as very small biological   or very large biochemical  . Without their hosts, they are not able to perform any of the functions of life, such as respiration, growth, or reproduction. Since the 1950s, many scientists have thought of viruses as existing at the border between chemistry and life; a gray area between living and nonliving. 
 If viruses are borderline cases or nonliving, viroids are further from being living organisms. Viroids are the smallest infectious agents, consisting solely of short strands of circular, single-stranded   without protein coats. They are mostly plant pathogens and some are animal pathogens, from which some are of commercial importance. Viroid genomes are extremely small in size, ranging from 246 to 467  . In comparison, the genome of the smallest viruses capable of causing an infection are around 2,000 nucleobases in size.  Viroid RNA does not code for any protein.  Its replication mechanism hijacks  , a host cell enzyme normally associated with synthesis of messenger RNA from DNA, which instead catalyzes ""rolling circle"" synthesis of new RNA using the viroid's RNA as a template. Some viroids are  , having catalytic properties which allow self-cleavage and ligation of unit-size genomes from larger replication intermediates. 
 A possible explanation of their origin is that they represent ""living relics"" from a hypothetical, ancient, and non-cellular   before the evolution of   or protein.  This view was first proposed in the 1980s,  and regained popularity in the 2010s to explain crucial intermediate steps in the evolution of life from inanimate matter ( ). 
 In 2024, the possible discovery of viroid-like, but distinct, RNA-based elements called   was announced. Obelisks were found in sequence databases of the human microbiome, and are possibly hosted in gut bacteria. They are different from viroids in that they code for two distinct proteins, called oblins, and for the predicted rod-like secondary structure of their RNA.

en.wikipedia.org,Vicious circle principle - Wikipedia,"The   is a principle that was endorsed by many   mathematicians in the early 20th century to prevent contradictions.  The principle states that no object or property may be introduced by a definition that depends on that object or property itself.  In addition to ruling out definitions that are explicitly circular (like ""an object has property     it is not next to anything that has property  ""), this principle rules out definitions that quantify over domains which include the entity being defined.  Thus, it blocks  , which defines a     that contains all sets which do not contain themselves.  This definition is blocked because it defines a new set in terms of the totality of all sets, of which this new set would itself be a member.
 However, it also blocks one standard definition of the  .  First, we define a property as being "" "" if, whenever a number   has the property, so does   +1.  Then we say that   has the property of being a natural number   it has every hereditary property that 0 has.  This definition is blocked, because it defines ""natural number"" in terms of the totality of all hereditary properties, but ""natural number"" itself would be such a hereditary property, so the definition is circular in this sense.
 Most modern mathematicians and philosophers of mathematics think that this particular definition is not circular in any problematic sense, and thus they reject the vicious circle principle.  But it was endorsed by many early 20th-century researchers, including   and  .  On the other hand,   and   accepted the ban on explicit circularity, but argued against the ban on circular quantification.  After all, the definition ""let   be the tallest man in the room"" defines   by means of quantification over a domain (men in the room) of which   is a member.  But this is not problematic, they suggest, because the definition does not actually create the person, but merely shows how to pick him out of the totality.  Similarly, they suggest, definitions do not actually create sets or properties or objects, but rather just give one way of picking out the already existing entity from the collection of which it is a part.  Thus, this sort of circularity in terms of quantification cannot cause any problems.
 This principle was the reason for Russell's development of the   rather than the  .  (See ""Ramified Hierarchy and Impredicative Principles"". )
 An analysis of the paradoxes to be avoided shows that they all result from a kind of vicious circle. The vicious circles in question arise from supposing that a collection of objects may contain members which can only be defined by means of the collection as a whole. Thus, for example, the collection of propositions will be supposed to contain a proposition stating that “all propositions are either true or false.” It would seem, however, that such a statement could not be legitimate unless “all propositions” referred to some already definite collection, which it cannot do if new propositions are created by statements about “all propositions.” We shall, therefore, have to say that statements about “all propositions” are meaningless.… The principle which enables us to avoid illegitimate totalities may be stated as follows: “Whatever involves all of a collection must not be one of the collection”; or, conversely: “If, provided a certain collection had a total, it would have members only definable in terms of that total, then the said collection has no total.” We shall call this the “vicious-circle principle,” because it enables us to avoid the vicious circles involved in the assumption of illegitimate totalities.

 A public meeting was held in The Castle, Shrewsbury, on Saturday, July 23, 1949, where the Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded.  The society was formed in order to both revive and promote old traditional Welsh dances and create new ones.    was the society's first president. 
 After Ceinwen Thomas had left college she met Walter Dowding of the Welsh National Folk Dance Society. She told him about her mother's recollections of folk dancing in Nantgarw. He put her in touch with Doris Freeman. Together  , Ceinwen Thomas and Doris Freeman worked to notate the dance steps from the traditional dances that Catherine Margretta Thomas could remember.  These notes were then passed on to the Welsh National Folk Dance Society by Ceinwen Thomas. 
 Since the founding of the Society, Welsh folk dancing in has had significant success in Wales and abroad. Workshops, lectures and courses arranged by the society typically have significant attendance. Dance events at Eisteddfod's also enjoy significant audience.

en.wikipedia.org,History of Puntland - Wikipedia,"( :  ), ( :  ), ( :  ), officially the   ( :  ,  : ولاية أرض البنط الصومالية), is a   in northeastern  . The Administrative Capital is   in the   region, and its leaders declared the territory an   in 1998. Geographically to the west, Puntland lays claim to the   territories that were outside European colonial rule during parts of the   period.
  archaeological sites preserve historical documentation about the trade relations between ancient Egypt and the nations situated along the   coastline. These records indicate the existence of a trading partner known as  , which is believed to have inspired the naming of the present-day region of Puntland. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether the ancient Puntland corresponded directly to the location of today's Puntland..
 Additional subgroups of the Harti clan, a division of the "" "" Somali tribes, including the  ,  ,  , and   inhabited the geographical region encompassing what is now known as Puntland.
 The   clans had established the  , which was situated at the easternmost point of the  , around 1600. However, at the onset of the 20th century, an internal conflict arose within the clan, which was subsequently exploited by  , resulting in the clan's incorporation as an Italian protectorate.
 The   tribe's settlement, located slightly to the west of the   community, came under British protection towards the end of the 19th century. However, following the passing of   in 1920, it returned to being under British protection once again.
 The   clan is predominantly situated in   and other regions of northern  . According to a historian narrator, the clan traces its origins back over 800 years. However, it wasn't until 1897 that the clan leader assumed the title of  , succeeding Mohamed Ali Sireh. Mohammed Ali Sireh had previously entered into a treaty with the British to establish a protectorate but later chose to join  . Following the conclusion of the rebellion, Mohammed Ali was subsequently deported, and the   community reverted to British protection.
 Consequently, within the   clans, the   tribes' community was integrated into  , whereas the   and   tribes became part of  . This division of territories under the Italian and British administrations was a contributing factor to the   in 2007.
 In 1960, the formation of the   occurred through the unification of   and  . The  , which eventually gained independence as  , held significant governmental roles during this period.

The speaker, on the other hand, claimed that Puntland was being controlled by a single clan, excluding others from the capital city. Four people were killed in a standoff related to the impeachment. A new speaker will be chosen within 14 days, and a committee has been appointed for the election process. There are reports of alleged interference from Villa Somalia, aiming to punish President Deni for supporting Ahmed Madobe, the leader of Jubaland.

en.wikipedia.org,Undescribed taxon - Wikipedia,"In  , an   is a   (for example, a  ) that has been discovered, but not yet formally described and named. The various   specify the requirements for a new taxon to be validly described and named. Until such a   has been published, the taxon has no formal or official name, although a temporary, informal name is often used. A     may not fulfil the requirements of the Codes for various reasons. For example, if the taxon was not adequately  , its name is called a  . It is possible for a taxon to be ""undescribed"" for an extensive period of time, even if unofficial descriptions are published.
 An undescribed species may be referred to with the genus name, followed by ""sp."", but this   is also used to label specimens or images that are too incomplete to be identified at the species  . In some cases, there is more than one undescribed species in a genus. In this case, these are often referred to by a number or letter. In the shark genus  , for example, there were, for some time, four undescribed species, informally named   sp. A, B, C and D. (In 2008, sp. A was described as   and sp. B as  .) When a formal description for species C or D is published, its temporary name will be replaced with a proper  .
 In  , a valid publication of a name requires the deposition of the bacteria in a Bacteriology Culture Collection. Species for which this is impossible cannot receive a valid binomial name; these species are classified as  .
 A provisional name for a species may consist of the number or of some other designation of a   in a   or other collection. It may also consist of the genus name followed by such a specimen identifier or by a provisional   which is enclosed by quotation marks. In the latter case, the   may be replaced by the       or  , meaning ""unpublished"". As of 2013, many species of the   genus   can be found in the   under such a designation.  An enquoted name, however, is not necessarily unpublished. It may be an   that has not yet been replaced by a  .

[it] is for the wanderer, the undecided, the lonely, and the promiscuous."" 
 , colonial governor of  , once owned a   farm near 8th and  . Such farms were located around the area until the 1830s.  Nearby, a Native American trail crossed the island via the   of  ,  , and  . 
 The   defined the street grid for much of Manhattan. According to the plan, 8th Street was to run from Greenwich Lane (now Greenwich Avenue) in the west to   on the east.  The area west of Greenwich Lane was already developed as  , while the area east of First Avenue was reserved for a wholesale food market.
 The plan was amended many times as the grid took shape and public spaces were added or eliminated. The marketplace proposal was scrapped in 1824, allowing 8th Street to continue eastward to the river.  On the west side,   was extended and Greenwich Lane shortened, shifting the boundary of 8th Street, ever so slightly, to Sixth Avenue and allowing  , Greene,   and MacDougal Streets to continue northward to 8th. 
 After the Commissioners' Plan was laid out, property along the street's right of way quickly developed. By 1835, the   opened its first building, the Silver Center, along Eighth Street near the Washington Square Park.   were also built on Eighth Street. The street ran between the  , built in 1832 at the west end, and the Tompkins Market, built in 1836, at the east end. These were factors in the street's commercialization in later years. 
 Eighth Street was supposed to extend to a market place at  , but since that idea never came to fruition. Capitalizing on the high-class status of Bond,  ,  , and   in  , developer Thomas E. Davis developed the east end of the street and renamed it ""St. Mark's Place"" in 1835.  Davis built up St. Mark's Place between Third and Second Avenues between 1831 and 1832. Although the original plan was for   homes, only three such houses remained in 2014. 
 Meanwhile, Eighth Street became home to a literary scene. At Astor Place and Eighth Street, the   was built by wealthy men and opened in 1847.  Publisher   founded a private library at his 50 East Eighth Street home.   started a famous literary salon at 116   and relocated to 37 West Eighth Street in 1848.

 In the 1850s, Eighth Street housed an educational scene as well. The  , a then-free institution for art, architecture and engineering education, was opened in 1858. The  , an arts and letters association, relocated to 46 East Eighth Street around that time; the Bible House of the  , was nearby. In addition, the Brevoort Hotel, as well as a marble mansion built by  , were erected at Fifth Avenue and Eighth Street. 
 At the same time, German immigrants moved into the area around  . The area around St. Mark's Place was nicknamed  , or ""Little Germany"", because of a huge influx of German immigrants in the 1840s and 1850s. Many of the homes turned into  , as the area had 50,000 residents but not a lot of real estate.   housing was also built on St. Mark's Place. 
 By the 1870s, apartments replaced stables and houses along the stretch of Eighth Street west of MacDougal Street. The elevated   and   Lines were also built during that time, with stops along the former at   and along the latter at  . 
 At the southwest corner of Broadway and Eighth Street, the street's first commercial building was built. By the 1890s, buildings on the stretch from Bowery to Fifth Avenue were used for trade.  In 1904, the   opened at the former   store along Broadway between 9th and 10th Streets, with an annex built at Eighth Street. 
 In the early 1900s, Little Germany was shrinking. At the same time, Jews, Hungarians, Poles, Ukrainians, and Russians from Eastern Europe started moving in. In 1916,   community and   established the  , which still operates.  At this point, St. Mark's Place was considered a part of the  . 
 On the western stretch of Eighth Street, an art scene was growing.  ,  , and other artists moved in the stables at MacDougal Alley at this time. By 1916, a studio complex for artists replaced most of these stables, making the areas around Eighth Street popular for  . Whitney, a patron for other American painters, combined four houses on West Eighth Street houses into the   in 1931. 
 The 1927 construction of the skyscraper at  , as well as the   movie theater, helped influence development on the Sixth Avenue end of the street, where construction of the   had required destruction of many buildings there.  On an adjoining block, the   was built in Jefferson Market complex in 1929–1932 and existed through the 1970s. 
 In the 1930s, after   ended, West Eighth Street became an entertainment area. Around that time, the   movement for   painters was centered around Eighth Street, with many such painters moving to Eighth Street. 
 After  , property along 8th Street was converted to apartment houses. The Rhinelander Estate, one of the major landowners on Eighth Street, erected a building between Washington Square North, Fifth Avenue, West Eighth Street, and the Whitney Museum site. Sailor's Snug Harbor, the other major land owner, demolished the blocks from Fifth Avenue to Broadway on the north side of Eighth and Ninth Streets, including the popular Brevoort Hotel. It replaced these blocks mainly with low-rise apartment buildings and stores, as well as two  .  Around this time, West Eighth Street was also becoming the location of neighborhood commerce. 
 After the elevated train lines were demolished in the 1940s and 1950s, the real estate industry tried to entice residents to the St. Mark's Place area, describing the neighborhood as "" "". This area became home to an underground scene, and as it was far from public transportation, it became rundown. A 1965   article described the East Village by telling readers to ""head east from  , and when it starts to look squalid, around the Bowery and Third Avenue, you know you're there."" 
 In the 1960s, Macdougal and West Eighth Streets, as well as St. Mark's Place, became a popular area for  .  A women's clothing store, a pharmacy, and bookstores were replaced by   restaurants and other shops, directed toward the area's tourism base.  By 1968, St, Mark's Place became a stopping point for  , which formerly skipped the area. 
 In 1977, St. Marks Place became the epicenter of  , when   opened its doors on July 7, 1977 (7/7/77).  The shop quickly attracted musicians from Cyndi Lauper to the Ramones. 
 In 1980, hot dog company   moved into the location of a former bookstore on Eighth Street, to the anger of some Greenwich Village residents. However, other establishments, such as the   bookstore, clothing stores, and shoe stores, started to attract tourists to the area.  By the 1990s, the areas around both Eighth Street and St. Mark's Place were becoming rapidly  , with new buildings and establishments being developed along both streets.  The Village Alliance Business Improvement District was formed in 1993 to care for the area around Eighth Street.

en.wikipedia.org,Artemis Fowl (novel) - Wikipedia,"is a     written by   author  . It is the first book in the  , the first cycle of  , followed by  . Described by its author as ""  with fairies"",  the novel follows fairy LEP       after she is kidnapped by twelve-year-old     for a large   of  .
 Throughout the book, the   switches from following the human characters to following the fairy characters to present underlying themes of greed and conflict. The book received a mostly favourable critical response and several awards.  A film adaptation titled   was released in the United Kingdom on 12 June 2020 and the United States on 10 September 2021 by  .
 , an elf in the Lower Elements Police (LEP), is tracking a rogue   that has managed to reach the surface of the Earth from Haven City, thousands of feet underground. Assisted by the technically minded     and   commander Julius Root, she incapacitates the troll before leaving for   to replenish her magic.
 Meanwhile,   is a 12-year-old prodigy who has dedicated his life to criminal activities. He leads the Fowl criminal empire, which has existed in his family for generations. After significant research, Artemis believes that he has confirmed the existence of fairies. He identifies an alcoholic sprite living in  , Vietnam, and travels there with his bodyguard Butler to obtain from her  —the fairy holy book that is written in  . After decoding the book using translating software, Artemis learns the specifics of the ritual fairies use to replenish their magic: take an acorn from an ancient oak tree near a bend in a river under the full moon and plant it elsewhere. Artemis and Butler track down 129 possible nearby locations for the ritual and start a  . They discover Holly performing the ritual, and Butler tranquillises her with a hypodermic dart gun.
 After being led onto Fowl's ship by Holly's tracker, Artemis tells Commander Root his name so they can find him, and then blows the ship up. An LEP retrieval team is sent to scout Fowl Manor using their   ability, which allows them to vibrate faster than the human eye can follow. The team enters the manor grounds, where Artemis has installed a camera with a high frames-per-second rate, allowing him to detect the threat. After Butler incapacitates the intruders, Root decides to lay siege to Fowl Manor using a time-stop and enter negotiations. Artemis states his ransom demand: one ton of 24-carat gold. Artemis also reveals his knowledge of the time-stop and claims that he can escape it. An analysis by LEP behaviour experts determines that Artemis believes he is telling the truth.
 The attempts to gain entry to the manor continue as the LEP recruits an infamous criminal, the   dwarf  , to break in. Fairies normally cannot enter human dwellings without permission, but Mulch has forfeited the magic preventing him from entering dwellings, causing him to be safe when burglarising. He tunnels underground to reach the house while Foaly feeds a loop to the manor surveillance system, allowing Mulch to freely explore. Mulch accidentally locates a safe containing Artemis' copy of the book, revealing to the fairies the source of Artemis' knowledge, which he had led them to believe he had acquired from a truth serum administered to Holly. The Fairy Council, deciding that nothing is working, promotes a lieutenant called   to acting commander, temporarily usurping Julius Root. Meanwhile, Holly cracks through the concrete of her cell, finding fresh dirt, and completes the ritual with a smuggled acorn. Having regained her magic, she escapes into the main house.
 Cudgeon decides to release the troll Holly captured earlier, into the mansion, to force Artemis to allow the fairies to enter and subdue the troll. This backfires, as Butler, aided by Holly's healing powers, defeats the troll. The Fairy Council subsequently strips Cudgeon of his post.
 Artemis is finally granted the ransom. The gold is sent in and Artemis asks Holly for a wish: to cure his mother's insanity—she has been living in her bedroom, driven mad by the loss of her husband. Holly grants the wish at the cost of half the gold. The LEP decides to send in a ""blue rinse""—a   that kills all organic life—to eliminate Artemis and allow for the retrieval of the gold, but this fails when Artemis discovers how to escape the time field and escapes the time-stop by drugging himself and his comrades with  .
 As Artemis has survived until the end of the time-stop, the LEP is bound by law to leave the remaining gold and depart. In the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using sleeping pills. Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, in which human characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses sleeping pills to break out of the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly's magic.
  has a number of underlying themes, but the most essential of these are greed and the  . 
 Greed is the first main theme that is introduced into the book,  and specifically the desire to obtain gold. In a similar manner to other themes in the book, it changes throughout, becoming less of a focus near to the end of the novel, where Artemis is (grudgingly) willing to part with a large sum of money to help someone else.
 The idea of conflict between good and evil is one that is touched upon in the book in a light-hearted manner. Although Artemis sees himself as an evil genius at the beginning of the book,  and is portrayed as such, the end of the story contradicts this image when he pays the fairy Holly to help his mother. Artemis's enemies, the fairies, would be ""the good side"", but their actions call this view into question—they are as determined as Artemis is to achieve their goals. While only some of them are willing to ruthlessly deploy a troll, regardless of the possible danger to life, all are willing to utilise a bio-bomb once Holly is out of the mansion, to eliminate Artemis. 
 In general, the book received a very positive critical response—in 2004 it received the   and Garden State Teen Book Award, among other awards. 
 The   said ""Artemis Fowl is great ... a new thriller fairy tale that will grab your interest, no matter your age.""  and the   said ""Fun to read, full of action and humour, this is recommended for all public libraries and to readers of all ages.""    said, ""  is pacy, playful, and very funny, an inventive mix of myth and modernity, magic and crime"",  while   said that ""Colfer has done enormously, explosively well."" 
  of   called the book ""a smart, amusing one-off. It flashes with hi-tech invention—as if Colfer were as much an inspired   as a writer.""  The   official review highly complimented the book, saying ""Fantastic stuff from beginning to end, Artemis Fowl is a rip-roaring, 21st century romp of the highest order."" 
 However, another   magazine review criticised the ""abysmal"" writing and the characterisation, calling Artemis' character ""repellent in almost every regard."" It concluded that   is ""an awkward, calculated, humorless and mean-spirited book.""    review concluded: ""All the familiar action-flick clichés are trotted out: the backstabbing, politically astute subordinate; the seemingly loony but loyal computer expert; the dabs of family loyalty; the requisite happy ending; the utterly unsubtle plugs for the sequel; the big action scenes. ... Resist the hype, parents, booksellers and librarians. This is not the new Harry Potter, nor is it a good children's book."" 
 In 2001, plans were announced for a film adaptation of the series.    was named as purchasing the film rights, with   signed to direct.  In 2003 Colfer stated that a   had been finalised and that casting was due to start the same year, but expressed scepticism over whether or not this would come to pass.  The film remained in development and was assumed to be in   until 2011, when it was reported that   was interested in directing the film.  In July 2013, it was announced that Disney was developing a project based on the first and second instalment of the   series.   and   would be the executive producers and   would direct.  The film was originally scheduled for a theatrical release on 9 August 2019 by  ,  but on 7 May 2019 the film was delayed to 29 May 2020.  On 3 April the film's theatrical release was cancelled due to the  ,  and instead it debuted on   on 12 June 2020.  The film was later removed from the streaming service on 26 May 2023 as part of a Disney+ and   purge. 
  is a   based on the book. Written by Colfer and adapted by Andrew Donkin with the art by Giovanni Rigano, the graphic novel was released on 2 October 2007.  The plot remains the same as the book's except some minor details.  Some characters' appearances differed from their description in the book;  's hair is longer than described in the book and a darker brown, as opposed to the reddish brown described in the book, and her skin appears noticeably lighter than the nut-brown  -like complexion she had previously been described as possessing. Haven City's roof is stalactites and rock as opposed to the computer-generated sky described by the book. The graphic novel does not contain many word balloons, showing each character's story in first person. Graphic novels for subsequent books in the series were released in 2009, 2013 and 2014.
 Later, in 2019, in promotion of the upcoming 2020 film, Disney released a new version of the graphic novel, this time adapted by   and drawn by  . It skims over the therapist reports and cuts out the second scene of Artemis and his mother for pacing.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/19px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/07/Artemis_Fowl_first_edition_cover.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/16px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_Fowl_(novel)

 The distinction between simultaneous hermaphroditism and sequential hermaphroditism is not always clear.  But unlike sequential hermaphrodites, simultaneous hermaphrodites are both male and female at  . Also   does not apply to simultaneous hermaphrodites (except in species with mix mating systems).

 Simultaneous hermaphroditism is one of the most common   in animals.  The majority of   are simultaneous hermaphrodites  and it occurs in over 67% of   species. 
 The primary model explaining the evolution of simultaneous hermaphroditism from gonochorism (separate sexes) in animals is the low density model.  This model explains simultaneous hermaphroditism as a reproductive adaptation to limited mating opportunities. This is advantageous to simultaneous hermaphrodites that can self-fertilize, because they are able to reproduce even if they fail to find a sexual partner. The low density model is helpful for understanding the development of simultaneous hermaphroditism in many animal species. For example, in   simultaneous hermaphroditism can be found in groups that are   or live in environments with limited mating opportunities.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Mice_X_Y_chromosomes.jpg/200px-Mice_X_Y_chromosomes.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/16px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_hermaphroditism

en.wikipedia.org,Broadway (Brooklyn) - Wikipedia,"is an avenue in the     of   that extends from the   in the neighborhood of   in a southeasterly direction to   for a length of 4.32 miles (6.95 km). It was named for the   in  . The East New York terminus is a complicated intersection with East New York Avenue,  ,  , and Alabama Avenue.  The   ( ,  , and  ​ trains) of the   runs on elevated tracks over Broadway from the   to East New York on its way to Queens. Broadway forms the boundary between the neighborhoods of  , which lies above Broadway to the northeast, and  , which is to the southwest.
 When Williamsburg was an independent city, the length of Broadway from the East River to South 6th Street was known as South 7th Street. From that point to Division Avenue, it took over the path of South 6th Street. Both of these segments opened in the 1830s. From that intersection to its terminus in East New York it was named Division Avenue,  which was laid on the municipal boundaries separating the   from the town of Bushwick (and village of Williamsburg, which was then part of the town). At each of the roadbed changes in Williamsburg, Broadway bends a little more to the south until it runs straight southeast to East New York.
 The   provided service (from the early 19th century) from the foot of Broadway to several points in Manhattan and by the mid-1860s was carrying over 200,000 passengers per day.  The ferry terminal was linked first to   and then elevated rapid transit in 1889.  With these connections, the central commercial area of Williamsburg began to migrate to Broadway from  .  This was further spurred by the opening of the Williamsburg Bridge although the section of Broadway from the new bridge plaza to the ferry landing river declined since it was now effectively bypassed.  Prominent extant buildings in Williamsburg located on Broadway include the   (at #175, built in 1875), Nassau Trust Company (at #134-136, built in 1888),   (#135, built in 1868),   (at 178, built in 1876), and several cast iron buildings such as the Sparrow Shoe Factory (#195, across Driggs Avenue from Williamsburgh Savings, built in 1882).  
 During the  , Broadway was the epicenter and worst hit of the looting, rioting, and violence that hit the city. Thirty-five blocks of Broadway from Williamsburg to Bedford-Stuyvesant were destroyed, 134 stores looted, 45 of them set ablaze. The riots accelerated   from the area, as many of the destroyed properties were never rebuilt and remained empty lots well into the 1980s.  Broadway remained a high-crime, destitute area until   in the 2000s which has initiated a resurgence of new businesses, construction of luxury condominiums, and a return of   to the area. In 2019, the   released a Bushwick rezoning plan, which would allow for high-density development on Broadway and Myrtle and Wyckoff Avenues.

en.wikipedia.org,A Bigger Bang - Wikipedia,"is a studio album by the English rock band  , released through   on 6 September 2005. It was the band's last album of original material recorded entirely with   on drums before his death in 2021. 
 Unlike their prior effort eight years before, the sprawling and eclectic  , which had an array of producers, musical styles, and guest musicians, the Stones set out to make a basic,   album that hearkened back to their 1960s–1970s heyday. A single producer,  , was brought in to co-produce the album alongside the band's   of vocalist   and  . Joining the two were band members   on guitar and   on drums, contract players   on bass and   on keyboards, and multi-instrumentalist Matt Clifford.  Most of the basic tracks were recorded as a simple trio of Jagger, Richards, and Watts, with overdubs added later by other players.
 The back-to-basics method of recording the album paid off for the Stones, who saw the album reach number three in the US, number two in the UK, and number one in eleven countries around the world. The lead single, "" "", failed to chart in the US, but was otherwise successful around the world, reaching number 15 in the UK and top-40 in over a dozen other countries. Two other singles were released to moderate worldwide sales.  Reviews of the album were generally favourable; while critics noted that the album was not up to the standards of the Stones classic period, it nonetheless was among the best reviewed of their later albums. The  , which lasted two years, would become the highest-grossing tour of all time by its completion.  A  -directed   titled   documented the tour.
 The album used a stripped-down style reminiscent of   (1978), but with a harder, more contemporary edge. Although initial reports stated that the Stones had ""returned to their roots"" with the record, the minimal instrumentation, rough mix, tough blues and ""garage"" rock hybrid bear certain similarities to the style of contemporary artists like   and  .
 Many songs were recorded with just the core band of Jagger, Richards and Watts.   was absent from many sessions, playing on only ten of the sixteen tracks, with only occasional contributions from outside musicians comprising the recording of the album. This is also the first album where Jagger plays bass guitar on some tracks.
 The Stones said in a statement that the album's title reflects ""their fascination with the scientific theory about the origin of the universe."" 
 Songs for   were composed by Jagger and Richards in June 2004 at Jagger's chateau in  , France. At the château, they learned of Charlie Watts'   diagnosis and debated about postponing the writing, but ultimately went ahead after determining that Watts was not required to be present until later. As a result of this, Jagger played the drums during early guide track recordings; all but one of these was later rerecorded by Watts, but Jagger's beat remained. Jagger and Richards shared guitar, bass, and keyboard parts between each other. The album was produced by   and the sound engineering was done by Krish Sharma. Mixing for the album was performed by   and  . 
 The song ""Sweet Neo Con"" is a criticism of the conservative Christian movement in American politics. 
 ""Dangerous Beauty"" is widely understood to refer to US Army Reserve  , who was convicted of mistreating detainees during the   that occurred at the   during the Iraq War. 
 The first single, "" ""/"" "", reached No. 15 on the  , while   peaked at No. 2 on the  . 
 In August 2005, the Rolling Stones embarked on the 90-show   in support of the album. It was met with sold-out tickets at every destination, usually within minutes of going on sale. The tour was extended into 2007 because Richards got hurt falling out of a tree in   and required surgery in New Zealand. The tour concluded in August 2007 at the   in London.
 Critical reaction was mostly positive. The aggregate score of the album by   was rated 73 out of 100, categorising the reviews as ""generally favourable"".    was touted as the best Rolling Stones album in years.  Nevertheless, all of the Stones albums since 1989's   had been similarly lauded,  and many critics and fans felt that the Stones had yet to record a late-period album truly up to their high standards. It was chosen as one of  's Top 100 Editor's Picks of 2005, and ranked the second-best album of the year by   magazine, behind rapper  's  .  A review by the   referred to the album as ""a winner"" that ""hammers home the fact that The Rolling Stones still have 'it'"". 
  went platinum in the US  and Germany,  and gold in Japan.  According to   it sold 546,000 copies in the US,  and as of 31 March 2006, 2.4 million copies worldwide according to  .

 The zona pellucida is a translucent matrix of cross-linked   filaments that surrounds the mammalian   and is 6.5–20 μm thick depending on the species. Its formation, which depends on a conserved   (ZP) module that mediates the polymerization of egg coat components,  is critical to successful fertilization.  In non-mammals, it is called the   or vitelline envelope.

Both defeats came in  , 5–2 at   and 5–1 at   and in both games they had their goalkeeper (  and   respectively) carried off due to injury.  With no reserve 'keepers available for the following fixtures Stoke resorted to utilising two outfield players,   v   and   v   in goal.

en.wikipedia.org,Wartburg (retirement community) - Wikipedia,"is a  ,   organization located in   that provides a continuum of care to older adults through residential and community-based programs and services. Wartburg was founded in 1866 as an orphanage and farm school and began serving older adults in 1898. As the   system took hold in the mid-1900s, Wartburg gradually phased out the orphanage and by 1979, its focus was solely on serving the elderly.
 The Wartburg Orphans' Farm School was established in 1866 by a Lutheran minister, Reverend  , with an initial gift of $30,000 from New York sugar refiner Peter Moller.  Originally, Moller had planned to use the funds to erect a lavish memorial for his son, whom he had lost in the  . However, Reverend Passavant, who had previously founded The Orphan's Home and Farm School in  , convinced Moller of the need for a similar orphanage in New York to help the great number of children left fatherless by the Civil War. Moller agreed and donated the $30,000 to help fund the new orphanage.
With advisement from Reverend G.C. Holls, headmaster of the Zelienople orphanage and Sister Elizabeth, a nun affiliated with a similar orphanage in Rochester, Pennsylvania, Reverend Passavant searched for an appropriate property for the new orphanage. Ultimately, they settled on 125 acres (51 ha) of land in   purchased from The Lutheran Committee for Charitable Concerns.  On a visit to the property, Passavant was believed to comment that ""This is something like the site of   where Luther translated the  ,"" of which Pastor Holls, later hired as the first director of The Wartburg, replied with ""Then we will call it The Wartburg.""  The Wartburg was originally incorporated under the name ""Deaconess Institution of the State of New York."" However, in 1884, a state charter was obtained, officially naming it ""The Wartburg Orphans' Farm School of the Evangelical Lutheran Church"".
   
 In 1865, the Rev. William A. Passavant, approached Peter Moller, about the need of caring for the orphans of soldiers killed in the Civil war and in the memory of his son who died in 1864, Moller made a substantial donation toward buying land and erecting the first building of what became Wartburg. Other wealthy German-Americans assisted, including John A. Roebling, designer of the Brooklyn Bridge. 
In 1866, The Wartburg Orphans' Farm School opened near Mount Vernon, New York. While open to children of any religious affiliation, it was closely associated with the Lutheran churches. The first director, or ""housefather"", was Rev. George C. Holls, who served for 19 years. 
Passavant called the school ""Wartburg"" because its high, wooded land reminded him of the castle near Eisenach in Germany, where Martin Luther found refuge in 1521-22 and where he began his translation of the Bible. 
The Rev. Gottlieb C. Berkemeier began his term of 36 years in 1885 as Wartburg's director, beginning four decades of rapid expansion, during which more than a dozen buildings were erected. In 1889, The Marie Louise Heins Memorial Home was completed, and Wartburg entered the field of care for the elderly. 
 Along with the addition of care for the elderly, Berkemeier introduced a ""family system"" whereby children were housed of a similar age and gender in one residence to create a family. The first of these cottages was the Kindergarten Building. The smaller, more familial housing arrangements provided house parents with the opportunity to nurture the individual talents and interests of the children. The Wartburg Boy's Band, formed in 1899, was open to any boy (and later to girls) between the ages of 8 and 15. Led by Professor Robert Steinmetz for 36 years, the Wartburg Boy's Band was recognized for their musical ability and performed in concerts throughout the Northeast and New England.  
In 1902, a fire destroyed the original Wartburg Chapel and later replaced in 1904 by a larger structure that accommodates 400 people. 
 The farmland on the north side of the campus provided the fruits, vegetables, and dairy products that were the core of the nutritional needs for the orphans and seniors at Warburg. 
 In 1922 the cornerstone was dedicated for the Jahn Memorial, which was built to provide a private residence for Wartburg's directors and their families. Jahn Memorial is located just to the west of Wartburg Chapel. By 1955, The Marie Louise Heins Home for the Aged had tripled in size, and two large wings were added to meet the demand for more housing.  
 In 1984 Wartburg ended its program of caring for orphans and at-risk children after 113 years. That same year, Lohman Village, a community of individual townhouses for older people who are still able to lead an active life and desire the security and assistance of Wartburg, was opened.   
In 1991, The Wartburg Foundation, Inc. was established with its Certificate of Incorporation charging the  newly formed entity with the responsibility ""to solicit, accept and receive monies, legacies, gifts, grants, contributions, subventions, endowments, and property of any kind, real or personal, and thereafter to hold, invest and reinvest the same"", with the ultimate goal of supporting the work of The Wartburg Home through Foundation Board-approved grants. 
 In 2011, Wartburg was chosen to receive a $27.6 million grant to fund two new buildings on campus: the short term-rehab/adult day facility and 61 units of supportive housing. The short-term rehabilitation center will be designed around the ""neighborhood"" model. Adjacent to this building will be the new adult day care building.  In 2015 Wartburg opened an Outpatient Therapy Clinic within its Rehabilitation Center of Excellence Building 
 Newsweek lists Wartburg 17th among senior care centers based on ""overall performance data, peer recommendations, and each facility's handling of COVID-19.""  In November, 2022 Wartburg was named by   as one of the best nursing homes in New York state.  Wartburg began constructing a new 50,500 s/f   and Related   Berkemeier Living Center at One Wartburg Place.","https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Wartburg.png/220px-Wartburg.png|https://maps.wikimedia.org/img/osm-intl,13,a,a,270x200.png?lang=en&domain=en.wikipedia.org&title=Wartburg+%28retirement+community%29&revid=1214978354&groups=_890f8abae3b61ee8d9d6ee00cd22879cec258b98|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Wartburg_lithograph.jpg/220px-Wartburg_lithograph.jpg|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wartburg_(retirement_community)

en.wikipedia.org,Subdivisions of Zimbabwe - Wikipedia,"has a   and is divided into eight   and two cities with provincial status, for administrative purposes. Each province has a provincial capital from where official business is usually carried out. 
 The names of most of the provinces were generated from the   and   divide at the time of colonisation:   was the territory occupied first by the British South Africa Company Pioneer Column and   the territory conquered during the  . This corresponds roughly to the precolonial territory of the   and the  , although there are significant ethnic minorities in most provinces.

Other government functions at provincial level are carried out by provincial offices of national government departments. 
 The provinces are subdivided into 59   and 1,200   (sometimes referred to as municipalities). Each district is headed by a District Administrator, appointed by the Public Service Commission. There is also a Rural District Council, which appoints a Chief Executive Officer. The Rural District Council comprises elected ward councillors, the District Administrator and one representative of the chiefs (traditional leaders appointed under customary law) in the district. Other government functions at district level are carried out by district offices of national government departments. 
 At ward level there is a Ward Development Committee, comprising the elected ward councillor, the kraalheads (traditional leaders subordinate to chiefs) and representatives of Village Development Committees. Wards are subdivided into villages, each of which has an elected Village Development Committee and a Headman (traditional leader subordinate to the kraalhead).",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Administrative_Divisions_of_Zimbabwe.svg/300px-Administrative_Divisions_of_Zimbabwe.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivisions_of_Zimbabwe

en.wikipedia.org,Wikipedia:WISCom Retreat - Wikipedia,"proposes a [3 days] strategic retreat to be held in [South Africa] from [24 July 2023] to [26 July 2023], to discuss community mandate resolved during the 6th Wiki Indaba conference in Kigali 2022 for WISCom to transcend its original mandate of supporting the hosting of Wiki Indaba as an annual conference. The strategic meeting will primarily discuss the creation of a regional strategy to support the growth of Wikimedia Communities in the region through the formation of an official [Wikimedia Africa Hub], its founding manifesto, organizational/legal structure, funding as well as its relation to Affiliates in the region. 
 The retreat will take place at the  , South Africa.
 Whereas, community members appreciated the clear mandate that WISCom was created for, which is a singular need to support local organizing hosts to successfully organize Wiki Indaba conferences, there was a general sentiment that the time had come for WISCom to provide more broader leadership in regional issues between conferences. These new expectations require intentional deliberations amongst WISCom members to come up with a clear proposal for a unified regional strategic priorities that community members can rally behind.
 During the closing session at the sixth Wiki Indaba held in Kigali 2022, representatives present debated the purpose of Wiki Indaba as well as the role of WISCom. There is great expectation for WISCom to resolve conference specific issues such as: 
 Restrictive scholarship regime which limits total number of conference participants, and limits international scholarships to 50.
Anglophone leaning conference which does not provide language translation (especially for Francophone attendees who are a significant portion of attendees).
Need for redesign of conference program to allow for clearer meta-level discussions to surface African perspectives on current movement-wide issues.
 In order for WISCom to successfully respond to these needs, it is necessary to review the current structure and set up of WISCom, including a serious discussion about the creation of an official [Wikimedia Africa Hub], its founding manifesto, organizational/legal structure, funding as well as its relation to Affiliates in the region and the Wikimedia . 
 The objective of this event is to bring together members of WISCom and stakeholders of the   to discuss and find solutions on several issues centered on the following items:
 As well as high level regional issues experienced by community members, including: 
 Proposed dates:	[24/07/2023]  -  [27/07/2023]
 Proposed Country:	[Johannesburg], [South Africa]
 We anticipate this to be an excellent opportunity for WISCom to discuss all of these topics and define clearly our goals and vision for the next years in order to advance the  .

Associated with the medieval Islamic notion of ""travel in search of  knowledge"" (الرحلة في طلب العلم), the   as a genre of medieval and early-modern Arabic literature usually describes a journey taken with the intent of performing the Hajj, but can include an itinerary that vastly exceeds that original route.   The classical   in medieval Arabic  , like those written by   (known commonly as  ) and  , includes a description of the ""personalities, places, governments, customs, and curiosities"" experienced by traveler, and usually within the boundaries of the Muslim world.

Concerning Ibn Jubayr's voyage to Mecca in 1183, one writer claimed that ""...his two-year journey made a considerable impact on literary history. His account of his travels and tribulations in the East served as the foundational work of a new genre of writing, the rihla, or the creative travelogue: a mix of personal narrative, description, opinion and anecdote. In following centuries, countless people emulated and even plagiarized him.""  Travel narratives were written prior to Ibn Jubayr's; for example, the 12th century   of  , and accounts of foreign lands visited by merchants and diplomats (such as the 9th century accounts of India and China by Abu Zayd al-Sirafi, and the 10th century   by   with the Abbasid mission to the Volga) long predate Ibn Jubayr's travelogue.

en.wikipedia.org,Self-licensing - Wikipedia,"(also  ,  , or  ) is a term used in   and   to describe the   phenomenon whereby increased confidence and security in one's   or   tends to make that individual worry less about the consequences of subsequent   behavior and, therefore, more likely to make immoral choices and act immorally.  In simple terms, self-licensing occurs when people allow themselves to indulge after doing something positive first; for example, drinking a diet soda with a greasy hamburger and fries can lead one to subconsciously discount the negative attributes of the meal's high caloric and cholesterol content. 
 A large subset of this effect, the  , is a   that occurs when a person's track record as a good   establishes in them an unconscious ethical certification, endorsement, or license that increases the likelihood of less egalitarian decisions later. This effect occurs even when the audience or moral   is unaware of the affected person's previously established moral credential. For example, individuals who had the opportunity to recruit a woman or Black person in one setting were more likely to say later, in a different setting, that a job would be better suited for a man or a white person.  Similar effects also appear to occur when a person observes another person from a   they   making an egalitarian decision. 
 Self-licensing can have negative societal consequences since it has a permissive effect on behaviors such as   and discrimination, selfishness, poor dietary and health habits, and excessive energy consumption.
 But recent scholarship has failed to replicate seminal studies of the licensing effect, and meta-analysis found it to be exaggerated by publication bias.  Furthermore, where licensing typically assumes that a good deed is the cause that makes subsequent transgressions more likely, an alternative (or additional) account is that people are faced with a temptation to do something morally dubious, and use a prior good deed as an excuse or reason why it is allowed for them to indulge.  
 Researchers Uzma Khan and Ravi Dhar describe the phenomena as follows:
 [A] prior choice which activates and boosts a positive self-concept subsequently   the choice of a more self-indulgent option, [by reducing] negative self-attributions associated with the purchase of relative luxuries. [...] We show that consumers may be unaware of how their prior decisions influence their subsequent choices. In other words, the process underlying the licensing effect may be largely nonconscious. Similarly, Anna Merritt and colleagues have explained that
 Past good deeds can liberate individuals to engage in behaviors that are immoral, unethical, or otherwise problematic, behaviors that they would otherwise avoid for fear of feeling or appearing immoral. It has been found that moral credentials can be  . That is, a person will behave as if they, themselves, have moral credentials, when that person observes another person from a group they identify with making an egalitarian decision.  In research that draws on  , it was also found that group membership moderates the effectiveness of moral credentials in mitigating perceptions of prejudice. Specifically, it was observed that displays of moral credentials have more effect between people who share   status. 
 Research suggests that self-licensing affects moral self-regulation and individual behavior in a variety of contexts; for example, it can influence consumer purchases, political opinions, charitable giving, energy policy and home energy use, job hiring, racial attitudes, health-related decision-making,  , alcohol consumption, and   use.    staff writer Michael Rosenwald described the following everyday examples of self-licensing behavior:
 We drink Diet Coke – with Quarter Pounders and fries at McDonald's. We go to the gym – and ride the elevator to the second floor. We install tankless water heaters – then take longer showers. We drive SUVs to see Al Gore's speeches on global warming. In a large   study, Hofmann and colleagues found evidence for moral licensing in people's everyday behavior outside of the lab, noting that ""committing a moral act earlier in the day was associated with an above-average likelihood of a subsequent immoral act and a decreased likelihood of a subsequent moral act."" 
 A 2011 study published by researchers in Taiwan indicated that people who take   pills, especially those who believe that they are receiving significant health benefits from supplement use, are more prone to subsequently engage in unhealthy activities.  Participants in the study were divided into two groups, both of which were given   pills; one group was correctly informed that the pills contained no active ingredients and the other group was told that the pills were multivitamin supplements. Survey results showed that participants who thought that they had received a multivitamin were predisposed to smoking more cigarettes and more likely to believe that they were invulnerable to harm, injury, and disease as compared with subjects who knew that they were given a placebo. Participants who believed they were given a multivitamin were also less likely to exercise and to choose healthier food, and had a higher desire to engage in ""hedonic activities that involve instant gratification but pose long-term health hazards"", such as casual sex, sunbathing, wild parties, and excessive drinking. In the 'multivitamin' group, the more supplements a participant used, the less likely they were to exercise, and smoking was highest among participants who expressed a conscious belief that multivitamins increased health. 
 The study's authors argued that because dietary supplements are perceived as conferring health advantages, use of such supplements may create an illusory sense of invulnerability that disinhibits unhealthy behaviors. Overall, the study shows that people who take supplements may feel that merely taking a pill is a sufficient contribution to healthy living to enjoy other activities without regard to health, and it exposes a potential hypocrisy among supplement users.  The authors advised:
 Smokers who take dietary supplements can fool themselves into thinking they are protected against cancer and other diseases. Reminding health conscious smokers that multivitamins don't prevent cancer may help them control their smoking or even encourage them to stop. Commenting on the implications of the study,   said this:
 Believing, incorrectly, that you've done something healthy by taking a vitamin pill makes you more likely to take genuine, concrete, real-world risks with your health. It's a chilling thought, but ideas aren't without impact, and every time we humour a harmless myth – that vitamin pills are healthy, that some fashionable berry prevents cancer – we might be doing more harm than we think. Researchers Khan and Dhar investigated the influence of self-licensing on consumer decisions regarding the purchase of  . They reasoned that ""relative preferences for a luxury option will be higher if people's prior decisions provide a boost to their relevant self-concept"". Due to the self-licensing effect, ""a prior intent to be virtuous boosts respondents' self-concepts, thus reducing negative self-attributions associated with the purchase of relative luxuries"". Furthermore, they predicted that consumers may be unaware of how their prior decision influences their subsequent choices; i.e. the process underlying the licensing effect may be largely nonconscious.  In the study, some participants were first asked to select from a list a charity organizations for which they would willingly volunteer three hours a week. Later, these people—and participants who hadn't been asked to volunteer—were asked whether they would buy designer jeans or an identically priced vacuum cleaner, assuming that they had enough money to buy only one. Participants who were asked to imagine having committed the charitable act before shopping were more than twice as likely to choose the jeans. The authors noted that ""People don't even have to do good for this effect to happen ... Even if they plan to do something good, it will give them a boost in their self-image. Any type of situation where you have guilt involved, you will see this, and so this happens in luxury goods."" 
 A study by University of Toronto behavioral marketing professor Nina Mazar and Chen-Bo Zhong found that people who bought green products were more likely to cheat and steal than those who bought conventional products.  The researchers conducted an experiment in which they asked college students to shop for products online from either an   or a conventional store. Each subject was then asked to divide a small sum of money between themselves and a stranger in a paradigm known as the  , in which participants can cheat to make more money. The shoppers from the green store were more dishonest than those at the conventional store, which brought them higher earnings in the game. The authors suggested that the results could be accounted for by the licensing effect, noting that ""When we engage in a good deed, that gives us a kind of satisfaction. With that self-satisfied feeling can come tacit permission to behave more selfishly next time we have the opportunity"". The authors added that ""purchasing green products may license indulgence in self-interested and unethical behaviors"", and concluded:
 We find that mere exposure to green products and the purchase of them lead to markedly different behavioral consequences. In line with the halo associated with green consumerism, people act more altruistically after mere exposure to green than conventional products; however, people act less altruistically and are more likely to cheat and steal after purchasing green products as opposed to conventional products. However, subsequent research not only failed to replicate Mazar & Zhong's findings, but found that green consumption had no subsequent licensing effect on dishonesty. 
 Researchers have invoked the self-licensing effect to explain why consumers who opt for energy-efficient products increase their energy usage so as to offset any potential gains. Energy economist Lucas Davis published a study showing that after getting high-efficiency washers, consumers increased clothes washing by nearly 6 percent.  Other studies have shown that people leave energy-efficient lights on longer than conventional lights, and that many people who make their homes more energy efficient turn their heating up and ultimately see no reduction in energy costs. 
 The self-licensing effect was examined by Monin and Miller in a 2001 study which demonstrated that when Princeton undergraduates established ""non-prejudiced"" credentials, they were more willing to express ""prejudiced-sounding"" opinions to an audience—even knowing the audience was unaware of their credentials.  Subsequent research by Monin and Daniel Effron, using subjects paid in candy or cash and excluding those who preferred Republican presidential candidates in the 2004 or 2008 election, showed that the opportunity to endorse   during the 2008 presidential election made those who did so more likely to express preferences favoring whites over blacks in hypothetical situations, such as hiring a police chief for a department experiencing racial tension. However, Monin and Effron cautioned that their ""experimental tasks left ambiguous the extent to which these preferences represented prejudice."" 
 Three   have been published on self-licensing.  Two of these meta-analyses suggest that the self-licensing effect might be moderated by culture,  and the most recent of these meta-analyses suggest that previous estimates of the effect may be exaggerated due to   (consistent with recent publication of failures to replicate the original finding ).",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-licensing
en.wikipedia.org,Stock and station agency - Wikipedia,"are businesses which provide a support service to the agricultural community. Their staff who deal with clients are known as  .  They advise and represent farmers and graziers in business transactions that involve livestock, wool, fertiliser, rural property and equipment and merchandise on behalf of their clients. The number and importance of these businesses fell in the late 20th century.
 These rural business services institutions originated, when communications were slow and often very difficult, to cope with the double remoteness of early   and   primary producers from their nearest settlement and, particularly in the case of wool, from their overseas markets. In practice, they were the pastoralist's banker. Similar and sometimes the same organisations operated in   and the  , which had extensive pastoral farming.
 These businesses grew to provide their clients with every product or service they might want right from employees or seasonal  working capital to, in the person of a client's personal stock agent, close personal friend and personal confidant who regularly visited them, maintained the client's loyalty and kept them up to date with events in the community and their industry. His branch manager might often be unable to maintain an easy relationship with clients unable to fulfill their financial obligations. The branch manager's knowledge of his client's business activities was such and his control over the client's spending was such he could ration their spending on sugar and flour.
 They also act as local managers of properties on behalf of absentee owners deceased estates and mortgagees technically in possession of properties.
 They provide retail stores in small towns for agricultural requirements selling, for example, animal health supplies, animal feed, fencing materials, fertilizer, machinery and tools, and even clothing and groceries.
 An important activity is to organise regular local livestock sales at a community's commercial saleyards. Small rural communities may hold a single annual sale at local saleyards and this may be the highlight of their autumn business and social calendar.
 A vital and well-liked part of their rural community, in remote areas, stock agents perform a variety of commercial and social functions. They bring to outlying homesteads on farms and stations stores, mail and newspapers, local news and gossip.
 Next the stock agent turns to real work and: 
reports to his client on market trends and prices; 
sorts stock into lines for sales; 
sorts prime animals for the freezing works; 
values livestock and advises on different marketing options for stock; 
arranges penning and auction; 
arranges private sales between sellers and buyers.
arranges transport of stock to saleyards; 
conducts sales of wool on behalf of clients on a commission basis; 
sells a wide range of agricultural products including chemicals; 
arranges clearing sales of surplus machinery plant and equipment; and 
arranges insurance.
 He also advises and assists clients in the management of agricultural or pastoral companies, stock or farming problems; 
arranges finance for the buying of livestock or property; and 
brings prospective buyers to inspect properties for sale.
 Individual stock agents, within the same agency, may specialise in any one of the preceding activities.
 ""Arranged marriage: Farmers expect their stock agents to perform a range of tasks and services. One agent even acted as a go-between for a client who wanted to get married but was too shy to propose to the woman!"" 
 The close and enduring individual client relationships which are formed are seen as a forerunner of the newer concept of relationship marketing. 
 In his history of the industry Simon Ville says: "". . . the stock and station agent has been a legendary figure in local folklore, connected or related to many individuals and groups, a central figure embedded in rural settler communities and about whom everyone has had a view. This social perspective helps inform our understanding of the agent's role and importance in economic activities since trust, reputation, and personal connection were the vital lubricants in sustaining business relationships and networks."" 
 Some of these businesses grew very large in the 19th and early 20th centuries.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Longridge_Settlement_-_Inspecting_sheep.jpg/220px-Longridge_Settlement_-_Inspecting_sheep.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/1963_Vauxhall_Velox_%28PB%29_%2822799031727%29.jpg/220px-1963_Vauxhall_Velox_%28PB%29_%2822799031727%29.jpg|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_and_station_agency

They help products to be the same in consistency, they are quick and easy to use in batch production of food products.
Some examples are pre-made stock cubes,  , icing, ready made pastry.
 Manufacturers use standard components as they save time and sometimes cost a lot less and it also helps with consistency in products.
If a manufacturer is to use a standard component from another supplier it is essential that a precise and accurate specification is produced by the manufacturer so that the component meets the standards set by the manufacturer.

en.wikipedia.org,Paris Agreement - Wikipedia,"The   (or  ,  ) is an international treaty on   that was adopted in 2015. The treaty covers  ,  , and  . The Paris Agreement was negotiated by 196   at the   near  , France. As of February 2023, 195 members of the   (UNFCCC) are parties to the agreement. Of the three UNFCCC member states which have not   the agreement, the only major emitter is  . The   from the agreement in 2020, but rejoined in 2021.
 The Paris Agreement has a long-term temperature goal which is to keep the rise in   to well below 2 °C (3.6 °F) above   levels. The treaty also states that preferably the limit of the increase should only be 1.5 °C (2.7 °F). The lower the temperature increase, the smaller the   can expected to be. To achieve this temperature goal,   should be reduced as soon as, and by as much as, possible. They should even reach   by the middle of the 21st century.  To stay below 1.5 °C of global warming, emissions need to be cut by roughly 50% by 2030. This figure takes into account each  .  
 It aims to help countries adapt to climate change effects, and mobilize enough finance. Under the agreement, each country must determine, plan, and   on its contributions. No mechanism forces a country to set specific  , but each target should go beyond previous targets. In contrast to the 1997  , the distinction between developed and developing countries is blurred, so that the latter also have to submit plans for emission reductions.
 The Paris Agreement was opened for signature on 22 April 2016 ( ) at a ceremony inside the   in  . After the   ratified the agreement, sufficient countries had ratified the agreement responsible for enough of the   for the agreement to enter into force on 4 November 2016.
 World leaders have lauded the agreement. However, some environmentalists and analysts have criticized it, saying it is not strict enough. There is debate about the effectiveness of the agreement. While current pledges under the Paris Agreement are insufficient for reaching the set temperature goals, there is a mechanism of  . The Paris Agreement has been successfully used in   forcing countries and an oil company to strengthen climate action.  
 The aim of the agreement, as described in Article 2, is to have a stronger response to the danger of climate change; it seeks to enhance the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change through: 
 (a) Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change;
 (b) Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster   and low greenhouse gas emissions development, in a manner that does not threaten food production;
 
(c) Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. Countries furthermore aim to reach ""global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible."" 
 The   (UNFCCC), adopted at the 1992   is one of the first international treaties on the topic. It stipulates that parties should meet regularly to address climate change, at the   or COP. It forms the foundation to future climate agreements. 
 The  , adopted in 1997, regulated   reductions for a limited set of countries from 2008 to 2012. The protocol was extended until 2020 with the Doha Amendment in 2012.  The United States decided not to ratify the Protocol, mainly because of its legally-binding nature. This, and distributional conflict, led to failures of subsequent international climate negotiations. The 2009 negotiations were intended to produce a successor treaty of Kyoto, but the negotiations collapsed and the resulting   was not legally binding and did not get adopted universally. 
 The Accord did lay the framework for bottom-up approach of the Paris Agreement.  Under the leadership of UNFCCC executive secretary  , negotiation regained momentum after Copenhagen's failure.  During the  , the   was established to negotiate a legal instrument governing   measures from 2020. The platform had a mandate to be informed by the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC and the work of the subsidiary bodies of the UNFCCC.  The resulting agreement was to be adopted in 2015. 
 Negotiations in Paris took place over a two-week span, and continued throughout the three final nights.  Various drafts and proposals had been debated and streamlined in the preceding year.  According to one commentator two ways in which the French increased the likelihood of success were: firstly to ensure that   (INDCs) were completed before the start of the negotiations, and secondly to invite leaders just for the beginning of the conference. 
 The negotiations almost failed because of a single word when the US legal team realized at the last minute that ""shall"" had been approved, rather than ""should"", meaning that developed countries would have been legally obliged to cut emissions: the French solved the problem by changing it as a ""typographical error"".  At the conclusion of COP21 (the 21st meeting of the Conference of the Parties), on 12 December 2015, the final wording of the Paris Agreement was adopted by consensus by the 195 UNFCCC participating member states and the European Union.    indicated they had wanted to object  to the adoption as they denounced the weakness of the agreement, but were not given a chance.  In the agreement the members promised to   ""as soon as possible"" and to do their best to keep global warming "" "" (3.6 °F). 
 The Paris Agreement was open for signature by states and regional economic integration organizations that are parties to the UNFCCC (the convention) from 22 April 2016 to 21 April 2017 at the UN Headquarters in New York.  Signing of the agreement is the first step towards  , but it is possible to   to the agreement without signing.  It binds parties to not act in contravention of the goal of the treaty.  On 1 April 2016, the United States and China, which represent almost 40% of global emissions confirmed they would sign the Paris Climate Agreement.  The agreement was signed by 175 parties (174 states and the European Union) on the first day it was opened for signature.  As of March 2021, 194 states and the European Union have signed the agreement. 
 The agreement would enter into force (and thus become fully effective) if 55 countries that produce at least 55% of   (according to a list produced in 2015)  ratify or otherwise join the treaty.  Alternative ways to join the treaty are acceptance, approval or accession. The first two are typically used when a head of state is not necessary to bind a country to a treaty, whereas the latter typically happens when a country joins a treaty already in force.  After ratification by the European Union, the agreement obtained enough parties to enter into effect on 4 November 2016. 
 Both the EU and its member states are individually responsible for ratifying the Paris Agreement. A strong preference was reported that the EU and its 28 member states ratify at the same time to ensure that they do not engage themselves to fulfilling obligations that strictly belong to the other,  and there were fears by observers that disagreement over each member state's share of the EU-wide reduction target, as well as Britain's   might delay the Paris pact.  However, the EU deposited its instruments of ratification on 5 October 2016, along with seven EU member states. 
 The EU and 194 states, totalling over 98% of  , have ratified or acceded to the agreement.  The only countries which have not ratified are some  : Iran with 2% of the world total being the largest.    and    .   Eritrea is the latest country to ratify the agreement, on 7 February 2023.
 Article 28 enables parties to withdraw from the agreement after sending a withdrawal notification to the  . Notice can be given no earlier than three years after the agreement goes into force for the country. Withdrawal is effective one year after the depositary is notified. 
 On 4 August 2017, the   delivered an official notice to the   that the United States, the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China,  intended to withdraw from the Paris Agreement as soon as it was eligible to do so.  The notice of withdrawal could not be submitted until the agreement was in force for three years for the US, on 4 November 2019.  The U.S. government deposited the notification with the Secretary General of the United Nations and officially withdrew one year later on 4 November 2020. 
President   signed an executive order on his first day in office, 20 January 2021, to re-admit the United States into the Paris Agreement.  Following the 30-day period set by Article 21.3, the U.S. was readmitted to the agreement.      took part in virtual events, saying that the US would ""earn its way back"" into legitimacy in the Paris process.      welcomed the return of the United States as restoring the ""missing link that weakened the whole"". 
 The Paris Agreement is a short agreement with 16 introductory paragraphs and 29 articles. It contains procedural articles (covering, for example, the criteria for its entry into force) and operational articles (covering, for example, mitigation,   and finance). It is a binding agreement, but many of its articles do not imply obligations or are there to facilitate international collaboration.  It covers most greenhouse gas emissions, but does not apply to international aviation and shipping, which fall under the responsibility of the   and the  , respectively. 
 The Paris Agreement has been described as having a bottom-up structure, as its core   mechanism allows nations to set their own nationally determined contributions (NDCs), rather than having targets imposed top down.  Unlike its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol, which sets commitment targets that have legal force, the Paris Agreement, with its emphasis on  , allows for voluntary and nationally determined targets.  The specific climate goals are thus politically encouraged, rather than legally bound. Only the processes governing the reporting and review of these goals are mandated under  . This structure is especially notable for the United States—because there are no legal mitigation or finance targets, the agreement is considered an ""executive agreement rather than a treaty"". Because the UNFCCC treaty of 1992 received the consent of the US Senate, this new agreement does not require further legislation. 
 Another key difference between the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol is their scope. The Kyoto Protocol differentiated between  , richer countries with a historical responsibility for climate change, and non-Annex-I countries, but this division is blurred in the Paris Agreement as all parties are required to submit emissions reduction plans.  The Paris Agreement still emphasizes the principle of  —the acknowledgement that different nations have different capacities and duties to climate action—but it does not provide a specific division between developed and developing nations. 
 Countries determine themselves what contributions they should make to achieve the aims of the treaty. As such, these plans are called   (NDCs).  Article 3 requires NDCs to be ""ambitious efforts"" towards ""achieving the purpose of this Agreement"" and to ""represent a progression over time"".  The contributions should be set every five years and are to be registered by the  .  Each further ambition should be more ambitious than the previous one, known as the principle of  .  Countries can cooperate and pool their nationally determined contributions. The Intended Nationally Determined Contributions pledged during the   are converted to NDCs when a country ratifies the Paris Agreement, unless they submit an update. 
 The Paris Agreement does not prescribe the exact nature of the NDCs. At a minimum, they should contain mitigation provisions, but they may also contain pledges on adaptation, finance,  ,   and transparency.  Some of the pledges in the NDCs are unconditional, but others are conditional on outside factors such as getting finance and technical support, the  ambition from other parties or the details of rules of the Paris Agreement that are yet to be set. Most NDCs have a conditional component. 
 While the NDCs themselves are not binding, the procedures surrounding them are. These procedures include the obligation to prepare, communicate and maintain successive NDCs, set a new one every five years, and provide information about the implementation.  There is no mechanism to force  a country to set a NDC target by a specific date, nor to meet their targets.  There will be only a   system  or as  , the former U.N. assistant secretary-general on climate change, stated, a ""name and encourage"" plan. 
 Under the Paris Agreement, countries must increase their ambition every five years. To facilitate this, the agreement established the  , which assesses progress, with the first evaluation in 2023. The outcome is to be used as input for new nationally determined contributions of parties.  The   in 2018 was seen as an example for the global stocktake.  After a year of discussion, a report was published and there was a call for action, but countries did not increase ambition afterwards. 
 The stocktake works as part of the Paris Agreement's effort to create a ""ratcheting up"" of ambition in emissions cuts. Because analysts agreed in 2014 that the NDCs would not limit rising temperatures below 2 °C, the global stocktake reconvenes parties to assess how their new NDCs must evolve so that they continually reflect a country's ""highest possible ambition"".  While ratcheting up the ambition of NDCs is a major aim of the global stocktake, it assesses efforts beyond mitigation. The five-year reviews will also evaluate adaptation,   provisions, and technology development and transfer. 
 Article 6 has been flagged as containing some of the key provisions of the Paris Agreement.  Broadly, it outlines the   that parties can take in achieving their nationally determined carbon emissions reductions. In doing so, it helps establish the Paris Agreement as a framework for a global carbon market.  Article 6 is the only important part of the agreement yet to be resolved;   did not produce a result.  The topic was settled during the  . A mechanism, the ""corresponding adjustment"", was established to avoid double counting for emission offsets. 
  and 6.3 establish a framework to govern the   (ITMOs). The agreement recognizes the rights of parties to use emissions reductions outside of their own borders toward their NDC, in a system of carbon accounting and trading.  This provision requires the ""linkage"" of carbon emissions trading systems—because measured emissions reductions must avoid ""double counting"", transferred mitigation outcomes must be recorded as a gain of emission units for one party and a reduction of emission units for the other,  a so called ""corresponding adjustment"".  Because the NDCs, and domestic carbon trading schemes, are heterogeneous, the ITMOs will provide a format for global linkage under the auspices of the UNFCCC.  The provision thus also creates a pressure for countries to adopt emissions management systems—if a country wants to use more cost-effective cooperative approaches to achieve their NDCs, they will have to monitor carbon units for their economies. 
 So far, as the only country who wants to buy ITMOs, Switzerland has signed deals regarding ITMO tradings with Peru, Ghana, Senegal, Georgia, Dominica, Vanuatu, Thailand and Ukraine.
 -6.7 establish a mechanism ""to contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gases and support sustainable development"".  Though there is no official name for the mechanism as yet, it has been referred to as the Sustainable Development Mechanism or SDM.  The SDM is considered to be the successor to the  , a mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol by which parties could collaboratively pursue emissions reductions. 
 The SDM is set to largely resemble the Clean Development Mechanism, with the dual goal of contributing to global GHG emissions reductions and supporting sustainable development.  Though the structure and processes governing the SDM are not yet determined, certain similarities and differences from the Clean Development Mechanisms have become clear. A key difference is that the SDM will be available to all parties as opposed to only  , making it much wider in scope. 
 The Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol was criticized for failing to produce either meaningful emissions reductions or sustainable development benefits in most instances.  and for its complexity. It is possible that the SDM will see difficulties. 
  received more focus in Paris negotiations than in previous climate treaties. Collective, long-term adaptation goals are included in the agreement, and countries must report on their adaptation actions, making it a parallel component with mitigation.  The adaptation goals focus on enhancing  , increasing  , and limiting vulnerability. 
 Developed countries reaffirmed the commitment to mobilize $100 billion a year in   by 2020, and agreed to continue mobilising finance at this level until 2025.  The money is for supporting mitigation and adaptation in developing countries.  It includes finance for the  , which is a part of the UNFCCC, but also for a variety of other public and private pledges. The Paris Agreement states that a new commitment of at least $100 billion per year has to be agreed before 2025. 
 Though both mitigation and adaptation require increased climate financing, adaptation has typically received lower levels of support and has mobilized less action from the private sector.  A report by the OECD found that 16% of global climate finance was directed toward climate adaptation in 2013–2014, compared to 77% for mitigation.  The Paris Agreement called for a balance of climate finance between adaptation and mitigation, and specifically increasing adaptation support for parties most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including   and  . The agreement also reminds parties of the importance of public grants, because adaptation measures receive less investment from the public sector. 
 In 2015, twenty Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and members of the International Development Finance Club introduced five principles to maintain widespread climate action in their investments: commitment to climate strategies, managing climate risks, promoting climate smart objectives, improving climate performance and accounting for their own actions. As of January 2020, the number of members abiding by these principles grew to 44. 
 Some specific outcomes of the elevated attention to adaptation financing in Paris include the  ' announcement to provide US$420 million for  , and the launching of a Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems (CREWS) Initiative.  The largest donors to multilateral climate funds, which includes the Green Climate Fund, are the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, France and Sweden. 
 It is not possible to adapt to all effects of climate change: even in the case of optimal adaptation, severe damage may still occur. The Paris Agreement recognizes   of this kind.  Loss and damage can stem from  , or from slow-onset events such as the loss of land to   for low-lying islands.  Previous climate agreements classified loss and damage as a subset of adaptation. 
 The push to address loss and damage as a distinct issue in the Paris Agreement came from the   and the Least Developed Countries, whose economies and livelihoods are most vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change.  The  , established two years earlier during COP19 and set to expire in 2016, categorizes loss and damage as a subset of adaptation, which was unpopular with many countries. It is recognized as a separate pillar of the Paris Agreement.  The United States argued against this, possibly worried that classifying the issue as separate from adaptation would create yet another climate finance provision.  In the end, the agreement calls for ""averting, minimizing, and addressing loss and damage""  but specifies that it cannot be used as the basis for liability. The agreement adopts the Warsaw Mechanism, an institution that will attempt to address questions about how to classify, address, and share responsibility for loss. 
 The parties are legally bound to have their progress tracked by technical expert review to assess achievement toward the NDC and to determine ways to strengthen ambition.  Article 13 of the Paris Agreement articulates an ""enhanced transparency framework for action and support"" that establishes harmonized   (MRV) requirements. Both developed and developing nations must report every two years on their mitigation efforts, and all parties will be subject to technical and peer review. 
 While the enhanced transparency framework is universal, the framework is meant to provide ""built-in flexibility"" to distinguish between developed and developing countries' capacities. The Paris Agreement has provisions for an enhanced framework for capacity building, recognizes the varying circumstances of countries, and notes that the technical expert review for each country consider that country's specific capacity for reporting.  Parties to the agreement send their first Biennial Transparency Report (BTR), and   figures to the UNFCCC by 2024 and every two years after that. Developed countries submit their first BTR in 2022 and inventories annually from that year.  The agreement also develops a Capacity-Building Initiative for Transparency to assist developing countries in building the necessary   and processes for compliance. 
 Flexibility can be incorporated into the enhanced transparency framework via the scope, level of detail, or frequency of reporting, tiered based on a country's capacity. The requirement for in-country technical reviews could be lifted for some less developed or small island developing countries. Ways to assess capacity include financial and human resources in a country necessary for NDC review. 
 The Paris Agreement has become a focal point of climate change litigation. One of the first major cases in this area was  , which was raised against the Netherlands' government after it had reduced its planned emissions reductions goal for 2030 prior to the Paris Agreement. After an initial ruling against the government in 2015 that required it to maintain its planned reduction, the decision was upheld on appeals through the   in 2019, ruling that the Dutch government failed to uphold human rights under Dutch law and the   by lowering its emission targets.  The 2 °C temperature target of the Paris Agreement provided part of the judgement's legal basis.  The agreement, whose goals are enshrined in German law, also formed part of the argumentation in  , where the court ordered Germany to reconsider its climate targets. 
 In May 2021, the district court of   ruled against oil company   in  . The court ruled that it must cut its global emissions by 45% from 2019 levels by 2030, as it was in violation of human rights. This lawsuit was considered the first major application of the Paris Agreement towards a corporation. 
 On 4 July 2022, the   of   recognized the Paris agreement as a "" "". According to the ruling of the court in Brazil it should ""supersede national law"".  In the same month the   in a resolution ""(A/HRC/50/L.10/Rev.1) on Human rights and climate change, adopted without a vote"" called to ratify and implement the agreement and emphasized the link between stopping climate change and the right to food. 
 The   officially recognized that ""Climate change threatens the effective enjoyment of a range of human rights including those to life, water and sanitation, food, health, housing, self-determination, culture and development."" 
 The Paris Agreement is implemented via national policy. It would involve improvements to   to decrease the   of the global economy. Implementation also requires fossil fuel burning to be cut back and the share of   to grow rapidly. Emissions are being reduced rapidly in the electricity sector, but not in the building, transport and heating sector. Some industries are difficult to decarbonize, and for those   may be necessary to achieve  .  In a report released in 2022 the IPCC promotes the need for innovation and technological changes in combination with consumption and production behavioral changes to meet Paris Agreement objectives. 
 To stay below 1.5 °C of global warming, emissions need to be cut by roughly 50% by 2030. This is an aggregate of each country's  . By mid-century, CO  emissions would need to be cut to zero, and total greenhouse gases would need to be   just after mid-century. 
 There are barriers to implementing the agreement. Some countries struggle to attract the finance necessary for investments in decarbonization. Climate finance is fragmented, further complicating investments. Another issue is the lack of capabilities in government and other institutions to implement policy.   and   is often not transferred to countries or places that need it.  In December 2020, the former chair of the COP 21,  , argued that the implementation of the Paris Agreement could be bolstered by the adoption of a  .  The latter would define the environmental rights and duties of states, individuals and businesses. 
 In September 2021, the Climate Action Tracker estimated that, with current policies, global emissions will double above the 2030 target level. The gap is 20-23 Gt CO2e. Countries such as Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and Thailand have been criticised of not doing enough to meet the requirements of the agreement, and are on track to achieve a 4°C warming of the planet if current policies are implemented more widely. Of the world's countries, only the Gambia's emissions are at the level required by the Paris Agreement. Models predicted that if the necessary measures were not implemented by autumn 2021, the global average temperature would rise by 2.9°C. With the implementation of the Paris Agreement pledges, the average temperature would rise by 2.4°C, and with every zero emission target reached, the average temperature would rise by 2.0°C. 
 The   report states that world governments still plan to produce 110% more   in 2030 (including 240% more coal, 57% more oil and 71% more gas) than the 1.5 degree limit. 
 In September 2023 the first global stocktake report about the implementation of the agreement was released. According to the report contrarily to expectations, the agreement has a significant effect: while in 2010 the expected temperature rise by 2100 was 3.7–4.8 °C, at   it was 2.4–2.6°C and if all countries will fulfill their long-term pledges 1.7–2.1 °C. However, the world remains very far from limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. To meet this benchmark, global emissions must peak by 2025, and although emissions have peaked in some countries, global emissions have not. 
 The agreement was lauded by French President  , UN Secretary General   and  , Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC.  The president of Brazil,  , called the agreement ""balanced and long-lasting"",  and India's prime minister   commended the agreement's  .  When the agreement achieved the required signatures in October 2016, US President   said that ""Even if we meet every target, we will only get to part of where we need to go.""  He also stated ""this agreement will help delay or avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change [and] will help other nations ratchet down their emissions over time."" 
 Some   and analysts reacted cautiously, acknowledging the ""spirit of Paris"" in bringing together countries, but expressing less optimism about the pace of climate mitigation and how much the agreement could do for poorer countries.   , a former NASA scientist and leading climate change expert, voiced anger that most of the agreement consists of ""promises"" or aims and not firm commitments and called the Paris talks a fraud with ""no action, just promises"".  Criticism of the agreement from those arguing against climate action has been diffuse, which may be due to the weakness of the agreement. This type of criticism typically focusses on national sovereignty and ineffectiveness of international action.
 The effectiveness of the Paris Agreement to reach its climate goals is under debate, with most experts saying it is insufficient for its more ambitious goal of keeping global temperature rise under 1.5 °C.  Many of the exact provisions of the Paris Agreement have yet to be straightened out, so that it may be too early to judge effectiveness.  According to the 2020 United Nations Environment Programme ( ), with the current climate commitments of the Paris Agreement, global mean temperatures will likely rise by more than 3 °C by the end of the 21st century. Newer   commitments were not included in the  , and may bring down temperatures a further 0.5 °C. 
 With initial pledges by countries inadequate, faster and more expensive future mitigation would be needed to still reach the targets.  Furthermore, there is a gap between pledges by countries in their NDCs and implementation of these pledges; one third of the emission gap between the lowest-costs and actual reductions in emissions would be closed by implementing existing pledges.  A pair of studies in   found that as of 2017 none of the major industrialized nations were implementing the policies they had pledged, and none met their pledged emission reduction targets,  and even if they had, the sum of all member pledges (as of 2016) would not keep global temperature rise ""well below 2 °C"". 
 In 2021, a study using a   model concluded that the rates of emissions reductions would have to increase by 80% beyond   to likely meet the 2 °C upper target of the Paris Agreement, that the probabilities of major emitters meeting their NDCs without such an increase is very low. It estimated that with current trends the probability of staying below 2 °C of warming is 5% – and 26% if NDCs were met and continued post-2030 by all signatories. 
 As of 2020 , there is little scientific literature on the topics of the effectiveness of the Paris Agreement on   and adaptation, even though they feature prominently in the Paris Agreement. The literature available is mostly mixed in its conclusions about loss and damage, and adaptation. 
 According to the stocktake report, the agreement has a significant effect: while in 2010 the expected temperature rise by 2100 was 3.7–4.8 °C, at   it was 2.4–2.6°C and if all countries will fulfill their long-term pledges even 1.7–2.1 °C. Despite it, the world is still very far from reaching the aim of the agreement: limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees.

 This was a publicly traded company during the dotcom bubble. IMHO, the article should include the historic NASDAQ symbol CTAC. It was one of the few dot-coms that turned a profit.

 I've added a POV tag because the article text does not seem at all neutral, especially in the opening paragraphs; there's language like ""compelling proposition"" that sounds taken from a prospectus or something.

Hosted by   in   from 13 to 22 June 2012,  Rio+20 was a 20-year follow-up to the 1992   (UNCED) held in the same city, and the 10th anniversary of the 2002   (WSSD) in  .
 The ten-day mega-summit, which culminated in a three-day high-level UN conference, was organized by the   and included participation from 192 UN member states – including 57 Heads of State and 31 Heads of Government, private sector companies, NGOs and other groups. The decision to hold the conference was made by UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/64/236 on 24 December 2009. It was intended to be a high-level conference, including heads of state and government or other representatives and resulting in a focused political document designed to shape global environmental policy. 
 During the final three days of the Conference, from 20 to 22 June 2012, world leaders and representatives met for intense meetings which culminated in finalizing the non-binding document, ""The Future We Want"", which opens with: ""We the Heads of State and Government and high-level representatives, having met at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 20 to 22 June 2012, with the full participation of civil society, renew our commitment to sustainable development and to ensuring the promotion of an economically, socially and   future for our planet and for present and future generations.""

The Earth Summit influenced subsequent UN conferences, including Rio+20 and set the global green agenda. ""The World Conference on Human Rights, for example, focused on the right of people to a healthy environment and the right to development; controversial demands that had met with resistance from some Member States until the Earth Summit."" 
 Major outcomes of the conference include the   (UNFCCC) – a climate-change agreement that led to the  ,  , the   (CBD) and the   (UNCCD).

There, the need to enhance the integration of sustainable development in the activities of all relevant United Nations agencies, programs and funds was highlighted. The discussion also encompassed the role of institutions in stepping up efforts to bridge the gap between the international financial institutions and the multilateral development banks and the rest of the UN system.

 The conference had three objectives – to secure renewed political commitment for sustainable development, to assess the progress and implementation gaps in meeting previous commitments, and to address new and emerging challenges.
 The official discussions had two main themes, how to build a   to achieve sustainable development and lift people out of poverty, including support for developing countries that will allow them to find a green path for development; and how to improve international coordination for sustainable development by building an institutional framework.
 In the months leading up to the beginning of the conference, negotiators held frequent informal consultations at UN headquarters in  , and in the two weeks before the conference was scheduled to begin, they managed to reach consensus on the sensitive language in the then proposed outcome document for the summit. 
 According to historian   in his 2014 co-authored 2014 book entitled,  , the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development – Rio+20 formal preparatory process, can be divided into three phases.
 Phase one took place from May 2010 to January 2012 – when preliminary intergovernmental discussions and negotiations began, and national, regional, and local level preparations were being made. This stage ended with the January 2012 publication of the draft document, ""The Future We Want""  The 1st Preparatory Committee was held from 16 to 18 May 2010, immediately after the conclusion of the eighteenth session and the first meeting of the nineteenth session of the  . The 1st Intersessional – which was not a negotiation session – featured panel discussions, from academia, non-governmental organizations as well as Delegates and UN system representatives – was held from 10 to 11 January 2011 at UN Headquarters, New York. The 2nd Preparatory Committee was held from 7–8 March 2011, at   in New York, immediately following the Intergovernmental Policy Meeting for the 19th Session of the  .  The 2nd Intersessional was held from 15 to 16 December 2011 at United Nations Headquarters in New York. 
 Phase two – from March 2012 to April 2012 – began with the first informal negotiations and concluded with the April 2012 release of co-chairs streamline text of ""The Future We Want"".  The 3rd Intersessional was held from 5–7 March 2012 at United Nations Headquarters in New York. 
 Phase three – from 9 April 2012 to 15 June 2012 – began with the second round of negotiations starting on 9 April 2012, and ending with the 15 June 2012 closing of the Third Preparatory Committee meeting, when negotiators were already in  , Brazil.  Th three-day intense meetings with hundreds of ""heads of states from around the world"" met in Rio de Janeiro after the 3rd Preparatory Meeting had concluded. 
 According to a 13 June 2012   article, the ""giant, 10-day-long"" Conference underway in Rio de Janeiro which would end on 22 June 2012, was ""expected to draw 50,000 participants, including delegates, environmental activists, business leaders, and indigenous groups."" For the final three days of the conference, ""about 130 heads of state from around the world were expected to be present."" 
 Billed as the biggest UN event ever organized – with 15,000 soldiers and police guarding about 130 heads of state and government, from 192 countries, and the more than 45,000 individuals gathered in   – the 10-day mega-conference was intended to be a high-level international gathering organized to re-direct and renew global political commitment to the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic growth, social improvement and environmental protection; focusing on reducing poverty while promoting  jobs growth, clean energy and more fair, sustainable uses of resources; goals first established at Earth Summit in 1992. 
 The conference centered around Agenda 21, the outcome document from Earth Summit 1992. That document was considered revolutionary in that it essentially created the term sustainable development and created the global environmental agenda for the next 20 years. The representatives of participating governments gathered in Rio to discuss what was then the draft text of the outcome document.
 Rio+20 sought to secure affirmations for the political commitments made at past Earth Summits and set the global environmental agenda for the next 20 years by assessing progress towards the goals set forth in Agenda 21 and implementation gaps therein, and discussing new and emerging issues.  The UN wanted Rio to endorse a UN ""green economy roadmap"", with environmental goals, targets and deadlines, whereas developing countries preferred establishing new ""sustainable development goals"" to better protect the environment, guarantee food and power to the poorest, and alleviate poverty. 
 Rio+20 attracted many protests, and more than 500 parallel events, exhibitions, presentations, fairs and announcements as a wide range of diverse groups struggled to take advantage of the conference in order to gain international attention. The British online newspaper   reported that, ""Downtown Rio de Janeiro was partly shut-down as an estimated 50,000 protesters, some of whom were naked, took to the streets."" 
 From 20 to 22 June 2012, world leaders and representatives met for intense meetings which culminated in finalizing the non-binding document, ""The Future We Want: Outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 20–22 June 2012"", which opens with, ""We the Heads of State and Government and high-level representatives"", having met at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 20 to 22 June 2012, with the full participation of civil society, renew our commitment to sustainable development and to ensuring the promotion of an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable future for our planet and for present and future generations."" 
 The first draft of the document was released in January 2012 as a result of preliminary intergovernmental discussions and negotiations that had taken place since May 2010. 
A streamlined version of ""The Future We Want"" was released in April 2012 following the second phase of negotiations. 
 At the Rio+20 Conference in June 2012, the heads of state of the 192 governments in attendance, renewed their political commitment to sustainable development and declared their commitment to the promotion of a sustainable future through the 49-page nonbinding document,   ""The Future We Want: Outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 20–22 June 2012."" The dates 20 to 22 June reflect the three-day meeting of world leaders, the culmination of Rio+20. 
 The document largely reaffirms previous action plans like Agenda 21. 
 The document, ""The Future We Want,"" called for the development of   (SDGs), a set of measurable targets aimed at promoting sustainable development globally. It is thought that the SDGs [would] pick up where the Millennium Development Goals leave off and address criticism that the original Goals fail to address the role of the environment in development. 
 There were eight key recommendations regarding the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), which included strengthening its governance to potentially become, a ""leading global environmental authority"", through universal membership, increasing its financial resources and strengthening its engagement in key UN coordination bodies.
 According to a 23 June 2012   article, nations agreed to explore alternatives to GDP as a measure of wealth that take environmental and social factors into account in an effort to assess and pay for 'environmental services' provided by nature, such as   and habitat protection. 
 Recognition that ""fundamental changes in the way societies consume and produce are indispensable for achieving global sustainable development."" EU officials suggest it could lead to a shift of taxes so workers pay less and polluters and landfill operators pay more.
 The document calls the need to return ocean stocks to sustainable levels ""urgent"" and calls on countries to develop and implement science-based management plans. 
 All nations reaffirmed commitments to phase out  .
 In addition to the outcome text, there were over 400 voluntary commitments for sustainable development made by Member States.
 At the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment, 40 African countries agreed to implement ""The Future We Want"". 
 A few key global leaders – mostly G20 leaders and namely    ,    , and     – did not attend the conference and blamed their absence on the ongoing  . Their collective absence was seen as a reflection of their administrations' failure to prioritize sustainability issues.  ""In not attending, the prime minister is sending out a powerful signal that the UK government does not see sustainability as a priority"", Joan Walley, chair of the UK environmental audit committee said to  .
 among others
 Activists took initiative at Rio+20 by staging numerous protests.  Activists joined forces to stand up to what they said was exploitation and degradation of the  , as well as the negation of the rights of  .   said that activists that support protecting the environment, are particularly relevant in  , as   threatens   ethnic groups every day. 
 In addition to holding signs and shouting chants, the crowds took a theatric route to convey their messages. Firstly, they poked at    , claiming she has given in to the global North's corporate hand.   Rousseff's controversy has arisen over her steadfast desire to further industrialize Brazil, and its economy. Additionally, the crowds assembled for a ritual and symbolic ""tearing up"" of the plenary's negotiated text,  conveying their disapproval.
 Thousands of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) gathered at the Flamengo Park in Rio. They criticized the draft negotiating text, particularly for its failure to mention planetary boundaries or nuclear energy, in light of the   in  .  Organizations, such as   and the  , as well as members of indigenous communities, activists and artists participated. The Danish artist  , the leader of the group  , and the Group 92 used his Freedom to Pollute sculptures to focus on global warming and its resulting increased flow of refugees. About 20,000 flyers about Freedom to Pollute were distributed during   and a related television program was produced in  .
 There were some demonstrations protesting the participation of the President of Iran   along with the Iranian delegation.  The controversy of Iranian attendance at the summit surrounds the fact that Iran has serious environmental issues, which it has refused to address, continuing human rights violations and is refusing to cooperate with the   over its contentious nuclear program.  Ahmadinejad was met with demonstrations, attended by thousands of people, on his 20 June arrival in Rio,  
 with some protesters waving banners with the slogan ""Ahmadinejad go home"". 
 During RIO +20 event and preparatory events   included stakeholders who were invited to organize side events, promote the RIO event, submit literature and help the Rio secretariat with translation work. The logo and promotion of RIO +20 was available in languages used in  . Civil societies also translated the logo image and literature in other local and National languages. 
 Ecology and Environment Inc., a New York-based Environmental Engineering and Consultation company partnered with UNCSD to create Project Earth Network, an online platform where schools around the world could showcase their remarkable environmental projects. In coordination with the Rio+20 event, the platform hosted a World Environment Day Global School Contest in which 7th graders at the International School of Ulaanbaatar (ISU) in Mongolia were declared the Global Winners for their awareness campaign on the environmental impact of plastic shopping bags, including research on plastic bag manufacturing processes, development of videos documenting plastic bag waste, and a school presentation at which reusable cloth shopping bags were sold to approximately 50 percent of the community.
 Sarasota, Florida's Brookside Middle School won in the World Environment Day contest's North American sub-category for its mangrove propagule growth project while International School of Brussels in Belgium won the European sub-category, for their creation of a sustainable food source and composting program. The Middle-Eastern sub-category winner was Hridith Sudev, a seventh grader from   in Oman for his organization, 'Project GreenWorld International', which helped promote sustainable awareness across the region through interactive projects. Hridith Sudev later went on to become an inventor and the organization has become a global environmental presence. The World Environment Day contest followed an Earth Day ""Green Schools"" contest regionally focused toward 6th to 12th grade students in the Western New York area.
 The idea behind the platform was to encourage sustainability in students across the world. Despite the huge response, the platform was taken down two years later due to technical and economic constraints but has since remained as a positive legacy through the activities of students who were first recognized by the network.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2b/Rio%2B20_logo.jpg/250px-Rio%2B20_logo.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/World_Leaders_at_Rio%2B20.jpg/400px-World_Leaders_at_Rio%2B20.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Flag_of_Albania.svg/21px-Flag_of_Albania.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Flag_of_Antigua_and_Barbuda.svg/23px-Flag_of_Antigua_and_Barbuda.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Flag_of_Argentina.svg/23px-Flag_of_Argentina.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg/23px-Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Bandera_de_Bolivia_%28Estado%29.svg/22px-Bandera_de_Bolivia_%28Estado%29.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/Flag_of_Brazil.svg/22px-Flag_of_Brazil.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg/23px-Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Flag_of_Chile.svg/23px-Flag_of_Chile.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Flag_of_Costa_Rica.svg/23px-Flag_of_Costa_Rica.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg/20px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Flag_of_Ecuador.svg/23px-Flag_of_Ecuador.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg/23px-Flag_of_France.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Flag_of_Grenada.svg/23px-Flag_of_Grenada.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Flag_of_Haiti.svg/23px-Flag_of_Haiti.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/41/Flag_of_India.svg/23px-Flag_of_India.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Flag_of_Indonesia.svg/23px-Flag_of_Indonesia.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Flag_of_Iran.svg/23px-Flag_of_Iran.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Flag_of_Lithuania.svg/23px-Flag_of_Lithuania.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Flag_of_Nepal.svg/16px-Flag_of_Nepal.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Flag_of_Nigeria.svg/23px-Flag_of_Nigeria.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Flag_of_Norway.svg/21px-Flag_of_Norway.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Flag_of_Portugal.svg/23px-Flag_of_Portugal.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg/23px-Flag_of_Russia.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Flag_of_South_Africa.svg/23px-Flag_of_South_Africa.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Flag_of_South_Korea.svg/23px-Flag_of_South_Korea.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_Spain.svg/23px-Flag_of_Spain.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Flag_of_Sri_Lanka.svg/23px-Flag_of_Sri_Lanka.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4c/Flag_of_Sweden.svg/23px-Flag_of_Sweden.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Flag_of_Turkmenistan.svg/23px-Flag_of_Turkmenistan.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Flag_of_Uruguay.svg/23px-Flag_of_Uruguay.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Flag_of_Zimbabwe.svg/23px-Flag_of_Zimbabwe.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Rio%2B20_statue_of_liberty_and_Dilma_Rousseff.JPG/220px-Rio%2B20_statue_of_liberty_and_Dilma_Rousseff.JPG|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Demonstration_against_Ahmadinejad_in_Rio.jpg/100px-Demonstration_against_Ahmadinejad_in_Rio.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Rio-hindi.PNG/220px-Rio-hindi.PNG|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/16px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/db/Symbol_list_class.svg/16px-Symbol_list_class.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg/19px-A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png|https://login.w

en.wikipedia.org,Mnemonic link system - Wikipedia,"A  , sometimes also known as a  , is a method of remembering lists that is based on creating an   between the elements of that list. For example, when memorizing the list (dog, envelope, thirteen, yarn, window), one could create a story about a ""dog stuck in an envelope, mailed to an unlucky thirteen black cat playing with yarn by the window"". It is argued that the story would be easier to remember than the list itself.
 Another method is to actually link each element of the list with a   of an image that includes two elements in the list that are next to each other. This would form an open   which could be traversed at will, backwards or forwards. For example, in the last list one could imagine their dog inside of a giant envelope, then a black cat eating an envelope. The same logic would be used with the rest of the items. The observation that absurd images are easier to remember is known as the  , although the success of this effect was refuted by several studies (Hock et al. 1978; Einstein 1987), which found that the established connection between the two words is more important than the image's  .
 In order to access a certain element of the list, one needs to recite the list step by step, much in the same vein as a  , in order to get the element from the system.
 There are three limitations to the link system.  The first is that there is no numerical order imposed when memorizing, hence the practitioner cannot immediately determine the numerical position of an item; this can be solved by bundling numerical markers at set points in the chain or using the   instead. The second is that if any of the items is forgotten, the entire list may be in jeopardy. The third is the potential for confusing repeated segments of the list, a common problem when memorizing  . This limitation can be resolved either through bundling or by using either the peg system or the  .",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_link_system

 This article does well at depicting the undertakings and early existence of Arthur M Wellington, yet neglects to recognize his thoughts for the designing economy. Wellington is viewed as a father of the building economy with his accentuation on thinking about an extensive variety of other options to taking care of a solitary issue, even the alternative of doing nothing if there is no gainful return down the line.

 The article was short in length, though covered the influences and impact that Wellington brought to the civil engineering profession. The article throughout deemed to be stayed neutral, but lacked certain important content the would be essential to understanding the contribution Wellington established mainly in railroad. The article did not elaborate on the book he written ""The Economic Theory of the Location of Railways"" in 1877. The book along with his name was introduced in the first sentence of the article, showing how significant the book is to Wellington's legacy. If the article would have gave further information about the book, the article's strength would have improved.

en.wikipedia.org,World Association of Zoos and Aquariums - Wikipedia,"The   ( ) is the   for the world   and   community. Its mission is to provide leadership and support for zoos, aquariums, and partner organizations of the world in animal care and welfare, conservation of  , environmental education and global sustainability.
 After the   (IUDZG), founded in 1935 at  ,  , ceased to exist during  , it was refounded in   in 1946 by a group of zoo directors from allied or neutral countries. In 1950 IUDZG became an international organisation member of  .
 In 1991 the IUDZG adopted a new name,  , and revised its membership rules to include regional zoo associations. 
 In 2000 the organization got its current name, the  , to reflect a more modern institution working together at a global level. The association wants to build cooperative approaches to common needs, tackle common issues, share information and knowledge. WAZA also represents the zoo community in other international bodies such as the   or at Conferences of the Parties to global Conventions, such as  ,   or  .
 All members of the WAZA network are obliged to comply with ""WAZA's Code of Ethics and Animal Welfare"", adopted by WAZA in 2003.
 Members of the association include leading zoos and aquariums, and regional and national Associations of Zoos and Aquariums as well as some affiliate organizations, such as zoo veterinarians or zoo educators, from all around the world. Together they are 'United for Conservation'.
 WAZA institutional members includes more than 250 zoos and aquaria. 
 In addition, about 1300 zoos are linked to WAZA through membership in one of the about 25 regional or national association members.  
 Outside of the WAZA associations with direct memberships, there are also regional organizations who are members of the WAZA through an affiliated regional organization. 
 According to the organization, there are two characteristics that all the institutions known as 'zoos' have in common:
 The definition of ""zoo"" is a broad one and it may also incorporate  ,  ,  ,  , rescue centers,   or even so called ""roadside zoos"" where animals are often kept in problematic sub-standard conditions.
In the view of the rest of the zoo community, which is committed to the principles of   and conservation, these roadside zoos do a lot of damage to the image of zoos in general and should be either assisted to reach a level of minimum standard or be closed down (which raises the problem what should be done with the animals they keep).
Not all of sanctuaries are managed by experienced zoo professionals and staff, being able to deal with a variety of animals with different needs and requirements. Also the keeping conditions sometimes do not meet highest standards and in a number of instances the enclosures reach rather soon their carrying capacity, because it is usually very difficult if not impossible to release the animals into the wild (and also difficult to find suitable and appropriate places in zoos), making it impossible to further accept more animals.
This may give rise to unjustified critique towards zoos in general in particular by some  , which object to the keeping of wild animals (and for that matter also of   and   in human care). Keeping wild animals in zoos is even seen as human domination over other creatures. On the other hand, objective and science-based critique by the less extreme and recognized   organizations is usually well received and may lead to improvements of problematic keeping conditions in specific cases. The ""umbrella organisation"" worldwide for the world zoo and aquarium community today, the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) has a complaint procedure, allowing to follow up on complaints received from the public. 
Among the questions that may be raised are:
 The modern type zoo aims to keep healthy, physically sound animals in natural surroundings, allowing them to behave naturally and normally. What is done in the interests of the animals kept is also done in the interest of the zoo visitors, who can thus observe the animals as if they were in nature.
The aims for the modern zoo are  ,  ,   and  . In fact modern zoos consider themselves as centers for conservation of   through   programs ( ) in particular of threatened species as well as various   programs, such as   and restocking projects, supporting in-situ conservation projects (protection of species and/or their habitat), transfer of knowledge and techniques, in situ educational programs aimed at the local people and at the politicians, biological programs (research and monitoring),   projects, social work among the local people,   activities and much more on a national and international scale. Therefore, some zoos call themselves today ""conservation parks"" or ""bioparks"". In the world, zoos more and more see themselves as modern arks for endangered and rare species. Within the concept of the modern ark, even projects of "" "" have been initiated, where   and   are stored under deep-freeze conditions in order to preserve them for a very long time. The mission of WAZA is to provide leadership and support for zoos, aquariums, and partner organizations of the world in animal care and welfare, conservation of biodiversity, environmental education and global  .
 Indeed, zoos are at present rapidly evolving to serve in multiple ways as conservation centres. Professional capacities of concern and subjects communicated to the public in earlier phases of zoo development are now vital services to conservation. As conservation centres, zoos must additionally address sustainable relationships of humankind and nature, explain the values of ecosystems and the necessity of conserving biological diversity, practice the conservation ethic throughout zoo operations and cooperate within the world zoo network and with other conservation organizations.
In recent years, great emphasis has been placed on creating new and dynamic exhibits at zoos that provide significant enrichment opportunities for the animals on display while also offering visitors a unique viewing and learning experience.
  involve zoo visitors in the environmental circumstances of the animals and such experiences are conductive to favorable reception by visitors of strong conservation messages.
 Only zoos,   and   can operate across the whole spectrum of conservation activities, from   breeding of threatened species, research, public education, training and influencing and advocacy, through to in situ support of species, populations and their habitats. They uniquely have a massive 'captive audience' of visitors whose knowledge, understanding, attitude, behaviour and involvement can all be positively influenced and harnessed. They have a huge resource of technical skills and dedicated people. As habitats shrink and collection-managed populations grow, the definition of what is a zoo, what is a botanic garden, what is a reserve, and who is a collection-based conservationist, who is a field-based conservationist, will inevitably blur. Indeed, zoos, aquariums and botanic gardens have an opportunity to establish themselves as models of 'integrated conservation'. In the German speaking part of Europe e.g. 45 zoos have united themselves in the ""Foundation species conservation"" with the purpose to advertise conservation projects on a large scale.
 Today many animal species are threatened with extinction to a great extent because of increasing threats to their natural habitat.
Zoos do not only keep such species in their custody with a view to maintaining   reserve populations, but they increasingly link their   activities with conservation projects in the field ("" "").
 With the human population worldwide constantly increasing together with an ever increase in demand for resources, and destruction of natural habitats, the role of zoos as conservation centres and   will become even more important in the coming years, combined with accumulating experience and knowledge on   and   conservation by the worldwide zoo community, which is increasingly committed to integrated conservation.
 Members of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the wider WAZA Network undertake or support thousands of  , or combined  -  projects. It is estimated that zoos, aquariums and zoo and aquarium associations jointly expend in excess of 50 million euros per year for such projects. Reintroduction and restocking projects have been undertaken with about 200 species. In addition, in situ activities include now often also educational programmes aimed at the local people and at the politicians, biological programmes (research and monitoring), socio-economic projects, social work among the local people, public relations activities and much more on a national and international scale – all in order to secure the conservation efforts far into the future.
 Since these efforts are largely invisible to the general public, in 2003 WAZA started allowing organisations to request and use the WAZA brand on projects executed or supported by the WAZA constituency.  Currently more than 150 projects around the world are WAZA branded.
 In 1993, The World Zoo Organisation (IUDZG) and the Captive Breeding Specialist Group of The World Conservation Union (IUCN) published The World Zoo Conservation Strategy. That strategy defined, for the first time in a single document, the responsibilities and opportunities that the international zoo and aquarium community needed, in order to be fully involved in nature conservation. The pressures and threats to wildlife remain and have indeed increased. The need for help in conservation has intensified. It is therefore an opportune time for all zoos and aquariums to re-examine the ways and means by which they can consolidate and increase their support and involvement in conservation.
In 2005 a revised, second strategy, ""Building a Future for Wildlife: the World Zoo and Aquarium Conservation Strategy"", was published by the World Zoo and Aquarium Association (WAZA). This document reinforces and expands the overall themes of the first document and presents a vision of the roles that all zoos and aquariums can and must play in the conservation of wildlife and of their ecosystems. The 72-page document, which is the result of assistance and advice from over 350 people, is truly international in its scope and in its production.
The Strategy is aimed at all zoos and aquariums, however large or small, however rich or poor, and not just those that are members of WAZA. The Strategy provides a common philosophy for zoos and aquariums across the globe and defines the standards and policies that are necessary to achieve their goals in conservation. The 2005 Strategy will be of use and interest not to only zoo and aquarium people but to anyone concerned with biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.
The document begins with a supportive foreword from the Director General of The World Conservation Union (IUCN), and a preface by the President of WAZA and by the Chair of the WAZA Conservation Committee, that set out the genesis and production of the Strategy. The document comprises nine chapters, with each chapter having a summary, a vision statement, a main text, conclusions, and a series of recommendations. 
This Strategy will be used by individual zoos and aquariums, by national and regional associations, and by WAZA itself, as the basis for the development of action plans for the implementation of the recommendations.
 The document is available today in English, German and Russian. Bahasa, French, Japanese and Polish versions, as well as Urdu, Hindi, Bengali or Bangla, Dari and Singala summaries are currently under preparation.
 In 2009, the World Zoo and Aquarium Conservation Strategy (WZACS) was especially implemented for the international aquarium community in the document entitled  .
 According to the current   (2008), 37 animal species are  . Zoo-bred animals of several species listed by IUCN as extinct in the wild did survive in zoos and have been reintroduced to parts of their former range in recent years ( ,   and the  ).
 The IUCN list also contains other species which were extinct in the wild in the past but which have survived in human care, and several of them have been reintroduced by zoos and wildlife parks to their original habitat (   ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,     ,    ).
However the IUCN does not list two species of   which were rediscovered recently surviving in human care.
 International   for endangered and rare species are kept under the auspices of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). In most cases, staff of WAZA member institutions serve as studbook keepers. The International Studbook Office is hosted by the  , and a staff member of the WAZA executive office acts as International Studbook Coordinator. Within WAZA, the Committee on Population Management (CPM) is the body dealing primarily with studbook issues.
As of March 2008, there were 183 international studbooks including all subspecies and species that are kept as separate studbooks. Altogether, there are studbooks (international and regional) and/or breeding programmes for more than 850 different taxa.
 Animal collections in individual zoos and aquariums are typically too small to be of much value to long-term conservation. Therefore, cooperative international or regional   breeding programmes are required to form large, viable populations. These cooperative breeding programmes serve many purposes: providing animals for public educational and/or exhibit opportunities; providing fund-raising material; providing research collections from which to gain basic knowledge of animal biology and husbandry; and, on a larger scale, providing demographic and genetic backup to wild populations. To serve in all of these roles fully, these populations must be viable over the long term. This requires that they be demographically stable, healthy, well maintained and capable of self-sustaining reproduction, distributed among several institutions to lessen the risks of catastrophic loss, of sufficient size to maintain high levels of genetic diversity.
Conservation breeding programmes (such as the   (SSP), established 1981, or the   (EEP), established 1985) are typically organized at the level of the regional associations, in particular   and  , because the exchange of animals between regions is expensive and - mainly due to veterinary restrictions - difficult. At its 2003 Annual Meeting, however, WAZA adopted a procedure for establishing interregional programmes, which may concern a number of species for which International Studbooks have been established.
 Until today only few of the rare, endangered or extinct-in-the-wild species could be saved from complete extinction by keeping and breeding them in human care. But it may be well too early to really evaluate the contribution of zoos breeding programmes to the preservation of biodiversity.
 WAZA works in partnership with international organisations with a view to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity. 
Two examples of WAZA supported projects on the occasion of the International Year of the Gorilla 2009 are:

Since the early 90s, WCS aims to help conserve biodiversity in Congo by working with the government, local communities and private sector partners to adopt a landscape scale management approach, establishing and maintaining a network of well-managed protected areas,
including the Nouabalé - Ndoki National Park.

The Cross River gorilla project in Nigeria has four main
components:
 Zoos and aquariums appeal to a very broad audience and have huge visitor numbers throughout the world. They enable people to develop appreciation, wonder, respect, understanding, care and concern about nature. They therefore have the potential to be a very important source of environmental awareness, training and action for a sustainable future on a local, national, regional or international scale. In fact they are excellent centres in which to inform people about the natural world and the need for its conservation. Awareness can be converted into action with positive benefits for wildlife, people and conservation.
 Living animals have an enormous power of attraction. Seeing, hearing and smelling them has huge educational significance in itself. The primary goal of living exhibits is   and educators increasingly are involved in the design of the exhibits. Animals are displayed in more natural settings, mixed exhibits and/or exhibits provide contextual story-led or message-driven experiences, using a variety of interpretation techniques. With an increasingly   population, this contact with nature is of vital importance and zoos build on it to promote and support conservation. Visitors will then more easily understand the concepts of   and the interdependence of species,   and  , and recognize the links with human actions.
 Zoos and aquariums have recognized that the visitors' experience is also affected by the welfare of the animals and their enclosures. Zoos therefore ensure that positive educational messages are not compromised or confused by poor conditions or poor   and that the animals are exhibited in the best conditions possible, in enclosures that enable them to live as naturally as possible and to exhibit natural behaviour as far as possible.
 Furthermore, enclosures clearly and correctly identify the animals in them. Signs highlight threatened species and species in regional, national and international coordinated breeding programmes.
 A number of activities allow  , such as keeper talks, close encounters, hands-on experiences, exhibits that allow visitor access, exhibits with a clear biological theme. Whenever animal demonstrations form part of the programme, they contain an education or conservation message.
 Resource material and education information is displayed and made available to the general public and zoo audience. This includes leaflets, guidebooks, teachers' notes, resource packs and worksheets.
 WAZA provides interactive, structured educational  , classes, and resources tailored to meet the specific needs of groups, zoos and aquariums and contribute to learning and understanding as part of local and national   frameworks. Many zoos now have an education department, a classroom, and full-time educational officers.
 WAZA encourages all of its staff to participate in local, national, regional and international networks such as the   (IZEA) and its regional groups.
 Today, through their living collections, zoos and aquariums can make a unique contribution to conservation-directed research. No other network of institutions can provide, as a resource for study, representative populations of so diverse an array of the world's wildlife. In addition, zoos and aquariums offer a rare venue for researchers and the public to meet and communicate, providing a platform for interpreting the outcome of research and explaining the implications for conservation action.
 There are two main divisions of research in zoos and aquariums: (1) research that is aimed at new knowledge to help the institution achieve its goals, and (2) research that is undertaken in a zoo by others to achieve their own goals, without being inconsistent with those of the organization. Under the first division would fall research on husbandry, visitor preferences, educational and interpretation methods, conservation approaches etc., to a greater or lesser extent depending on a zoo's particular mission. The latter division would include assisting researchers from universities and research organizations by providing access to and or material from non-domesticated species for comparative analyses. 
It is impossible to describe all of the research undertaken by and at zoos and aquariums. Though there are areas of overlap, research can be divided into the following categories: 
 Although   is today not the main aim of zoos anymore, it is clear that it plays still a very important role. People, especially from urbanized areas are often alienated from nature, have in a zoo the opportunity to relax and to enjoy a naturalistic environment in their very neighborhood. The profound positive influence nature – also in form of plants and   – has on the psychic well-being of men, women and children in the very hectic, technical (and often virtual) world today has been demonstrated many times. Zoos make here no exception. They are places without the daily stress of the professional life, usually places of quiet and calmness with profound positive emotional experiences that allow people to immerge into another world – even in the middle of busy cities. This therefore is also one of the many reasons why zoos are visited today by young and old by the millions.
 Zoos personnel know that this experience is possible only if visitors have the impression that the animals are healthy and well kept in naturalistic habitat-like enclosures. Therefore, when planning new exhibits today this is taken into consideration.
 Within the twentieth century great strides had been made in the development of management methods and of principles and techniques relating to the maintenance of captive populations that increasingly satisfied the physical and psychological needs of the animals.
Together with the increasing practical experiences in modern  , various developments in the science of   (in particular prevention and control of   and causes of  ), enormous technical advances and the accumulation of knowledge of all kinds, it became possible to venture exhibits which before had not seemed possible.
Zoos today provide exhibits of such size, volume, structure and objects as to allow the animals to express their natural behaviours. Also the animals are provided areas to which they may retreat. In addition separate facilities are available to allow separation of animals where necessary, e.g. cubbing dens. Efforts are made to protected animals at all times from conditions detrimental to their well-being.
 Proper feeding management of wild animals in zoos and aquariums incorporates both husbandry skills and applied nutritional sciences. As a basic foundation of animal management, nutrition is integral to longevity, disease prevention, growth and reproduction. Additionally food collecting and/or gathering contributes to behavioral enrichment and provides occupation. Quite elaborate systems of food presentation (dead rats) have been developed (e.g. in Switzerland for wild cats), where computer programmed various mechanic devices allow the animals in the enclosure to search for prey as in their natural environment. However, in some cases animals in zoos need to be fed with other live animals, because they would not eat non-living food items. Whenever this has to be done however, the prey should have, as in natural conditions, a possibility to hide and it must be assured that the prey animal is killed as quickly as possible without pain and suffering. Whenever the animals accept dead prey or food items, they are not to be given live animals as food.
 Indeed, most contemporary zoos led by professionals are aware of environmental enrichment, also called  , as a part of the daily care of animals. Environmental enrichment refers to the practice of providing animals with environmental  . The goal of environmental enrichment is to improve an animal's quality of life by increasing physical activity, stimulating natural behaviors, and preventing or reducing  .
 Also the use of behavioral training, as another method of behavioral enrichment, has often contributed to the animals well-being as well as allowed zoos to improve dramatically their ability to care for animals, while reducing animal stress and increasing safety for both keeper and animal during care procedures. It is self-evident that such training must be done by expert keepers in a way that is appropriate to the animals, based on biological and scientifically sound learning principles.
 At the beginning of the twentieth century, zoos acquired many animals that were caught in the wild. Today however zoos acquire animals much more frequently through their ex-situ breeding programs, trade or exchange (or loans and gifts) among zoos (often following the advice of the appropriate Species Co-ordinators). Zoos make sure that institutions receiving their animals have appropriate facilities to hold them and skilled staff that are capable of maintaining the same high standard of husbandry and welfare as they themselves. However it is recognized that, from time to time, there is a legitimate need for conservation breeding programs, education programs or basic biological studies, to obtain animals from the wild. The collection, trade, and transport of wild animals is strictly regulated today by national and international legislation (in particular  ,   and  ) and is controlled by government agencies. In particular the CITES provisions make sure that such acquisitions will not have a deleterious effect upon the wild population. Various surveys have shown however that the acquisition of wild caught animals (in particular mammals, birds and reptiles) by zoos has decreased significantly in the last years and that zoos increasingly manage to maintain their collections without introduction of animals caught in the wild. Indeed, many species are bred in zoos using sophisticated, and expensive, scientific procedures.
 The situation is somewhat different for aquaria, where – although an increasing number of fish and invertebrates can be bred in human care – still newly acquired animals are predominantly wild-caught. One of the reasons is that reproduction in aquaria just has not been possible yet or is – still – too expensive.
 In fact the World Zoo Conservation Strategy published in 1993 states ""that the commercial wild animal trade as a source of zoo animals should cease as soon as possible. Such animals as must be collected from the wild must be collected for specific educational and conservation purposes. They should not be chosen from dealers' lists of animals randomly collected for commercial purposes."" These goals, while more pertinent in 1993, are still valid and show up again in the World Zoo and Aquarium Conservation Strategy published in 2005. Since then, this has meant that zoos disapprove of selling their ""surplus"" animals to animal dealers, auctions and  , unaccredited zoos and individuals without the necessary knowledge and expertise, respectively without the keeping-license required by national legislation.
 All animals being transferred are usually accompanied today by appropriate records with details of health, diet, reproductive and genetic status and behavioural characteristics having been disclosed at the commencement of negotiations. These records will allow the receiving institution to make appropriate decisions regarding the future management of the animal. All animal transfers must conform to the international standards and laws applying to the particular species. Where appropriate or required by legislation, animals are accompanied by qualified staff.
  and animal welfare organizations also contact zoos whenever the need arises to place an animal   because it has been illegally imported or acquired or has been rescued from unsuitable circumstances and which needs special and expert care and appropriate housing. Zoos usually are cooperative but they also may have to decline to take such animals in their custody when e.g. they do not have appropriate   facilities, have no appropriate enclosures, fear the risk of   when accepting an animal of unknown origin, don't see any purpose in incorporating an animal of unknown origin into their breeding program or see no way how such an animal could be integrated socially into their group of conspecifics.
 In keeping with the requirements of animal welfare standards, the adaptive capacity of wild animals in zoos must not be compromised, nor their functional capabilities allowed to atrophy. Furthermore, animals in zoos must be kept in a manner that accommodates their natural behaviour. Reproductive behaviour is central to this consideration. Reproduction in all its aspects ( ,  , nest building, parents-infant bonding, socialization of the young, integrating offspring into the group, influencing the social structure, transfer of knowledge, capabilities and traditions etc.) is indeed a significant part of the animal's natural behaviour. Impeding   may cause distress, social disorder, deprivation etc. Therefore, generally speaking, animals should not be prevented from breeding. However whilst this principle is valid for all animal species irrespective of their   emotional value, it is not applicable to each and every individual. In the implementation of this principle, it may be necessary to humanely   individual animals at times that approximate certain critical events they would encounter in the wild state (e.g. birth,  , leaving the family group). In nature animals generally produce surplus offspring and not every individual is actually able to reproduce. In addition to the already mentioned critical phases in the life cycle of an animal, various other factors such as  ,  , disease,  ,  ,   and climate regulate population sizes. Reproductive management in zoos should reflect natural circumstances. In regulating the size of their animal stocks and populations zoos thus may pursue the following strategies:
 When contraception is considered, the possible side effects of both surgical and chemical contraception, as well as the negative impact on behavior and social structure of the group should be considered before the final decision to implement contraception is made.
 When all options have been investigated and none of these measures are feasible without causing stress or impacting upon group behaviour and the decision is taken that it is necessary to euthanize an animal, care will be taken to ensure it is carried out in a fear free environment and a manner that ensures a quick death without suffering. Euthanasia may be controlled by local customs and laws but should always be used in preference to keeping an animal alive under conditions which do not allow it to experience an appropriate quality of life. Whenever possible a post-mortem examination should be performed and biological material preserved for research and gene conservation. If   and   allows it, there is nothing wrong with ""recycling"" remains of such animals into the zoo's own  .
 Zoos usually avoid talking about death. In particular, they do not convey that sometimes it may be unavoidable to kill animals with a view of keeping a breeding programme alive and viable.
The largest problem for long-term conservation breeding at zoos will be the lack of understanding by the public that nature is based on surplus, i.e. that always more animals are born than are necessary for maintaining their own species, and that these surplus animals will end up in the food chain, thus ensuring the survival of other species.
 A permanent Executive Office has been established in October 2001. The Office was located in the centre of  , Switzerland at this time. From May 2010 to September 2018, the WAZA Executive Office was situated in the heart of IUCN's newly built Conservation Centre in  , Switzerland.

en.wikipedia.org,Xenohormesis - Wikipedia,"is a hypothesis that posits that certain molecules such as plant  , which indicate   in the plants, can have benefits of another organism ( ) which consumes it. Or in simpler terms, xenohormesis is interspecies  . The expected benefits include improve lifespan and fitness, by activating the animal's cellular stress response. 
 This may be useful to evolve, as it gives possible cues about the state of the environment. If the plants an animal is eating have increased polyphenol content, it means the plant is under stress and may signal famines. Using the chemical cues the heterotophs could preemptively prepare and defend itself before conditions worsen. A possible example may be  , which is famously found in red wine, which modulates over two dozen receptors and enzymes in mammals. 
 Xenohormesis could also explain several phenomena seen in the ethno-pharmaceutical (traditional medicine) side of things. Such as in the case of  , which in several studies have shown to help treat  , but hasn't been confirmed in  . This can be caused by the cinnamon used in one study differing from the other in xenohormic properties. 
 Some explanations as to why this works, is first and foremost, it could be a coincidence. Especially for cases which partially venomous products, cause a positive stress in the organism. The second is that it is a shared evolutionary attribute, as both animals and plants share a huge amount of   between their pathways. The third is that there is evolutionary pressure to evolve to better respond to the molecules. The latter is proposed mainly by Howitz and his team. 
 There also might be the problem that our focus on maximizing the crop output, may be losing many of the xenohormetic advantages. Although the ideal conditions will cause the plant to increase its crop output it can also be argued it is loosing stress and therefore the hormesis. The     may be caused by lack of consumption of stressed nutrients. 
 The term xenohormesis was first coined by Kondrad T. Howitz and  , in the 2004 paper ""Small molecules that regulate lifespan: evidence for xenohormesis"".    comes from greek, meaning foreign, and   is the adaptive response of organisms and cells to stress. 
 There are many applications for this products, mainly found in the micronutrients. One of the most obvious ones is in the pharmaceutical section. Such as the     which is synthesised from   The density of this product also increases with stress, which is probably not a coincidence, however not in a case of mutualistic xenohormesis.  
 It has also been shown that it affects macro nutrients, cold shock may increase the level of unsaturated  . 
 Some times xenohormesis is targeted to specific organisms. Such as in the case  , which produce  , which the ants consume, in turn protecting the tree. If a herbivore feeds on an Acacia, it will release more of these bodies. In turn attracting more ants and/or wasps. There are also many cases of mutualistic xenohormesis for the dispersal of a seeds and pollen. Though not all xenohormesis is mutualistic.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/C_Millas_D%27Oro_pinolillo.jpg/168px-C_Millas_D%27Oro_pinolillo.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Artemisia_annua.jpeg/188px-Artemisia_annua.jpeg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Pseudomyrmex_ferruginea_Ryan_Somma-cropped.jpg/220px-Pseudomyrmex_ferruginea_Ryan_Somma-cropped.jpg|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenohormesis

en.wikipedia.org,Teach-back method - Wikipedia,"The  , also called the  , is a communication confirmation method used by healthcare providers to confirm whether a patient (or care takers) understands what is being explained to them. If a patient understands, they are able to ""teach-back"" the information accurately. This is a communication method intended to improve  .
 There can be a significant gap in the perception of how much a patient needs information, or how effective a provider's communication is.  This can be due to various reasons such as a patient not understanding medical terminology, not feeling comfortable asking questions or even cognitive impairment.  Not only does the teach-back method help providers understand the patient's needs in understanding their care, it also allows providers to evaluate their communication skills.  Case studies led by the   on the informed consent processes of various hospitals found that those that effectively used the teach-back method benefited in areas of quality, patient safety, risk management and cost/efficiency. 
 The   describes the practice as follows: 
  should use the method→ Any healthcare providers. E.g. physicians, nurses, healthcare professionals 
  should patients teach-back→Information about their diagnosis, treatment plan, medications, risks and benefit of treatment, etc. 
  to ask for teach-back→ Early in the care process 
  is it important→Many patients have difficulty understanding medical information. 
 →When asked to teach-back, patients should be able to clearly describe or explain the information provided to them. 
 
Depending on the patient's successful or unsuccessful teach-back, the provider will clarify or modify the information and reassess the teach-back to confirm the patient's comprehension and understanding. 
 The cycle of reassessing and teaching back to confirm comprehension has been found to improve knowledge retention and lower readmission rates in heart failure patients. 
 Beyond healthcare literacy, the teach-back method can be utilized in academic and professional settings as well. Teachers often create    in which the instructor asks the student to share what they heard, and promote peer to peer coaching  where students explain what they just learned to other students.

Violators of the law are liable to fines and/or imprisonment.   In  , for example, the prohibition of tribal marks is an integral part of the state  , a law that imposes a fine or one-month imprisonment or both for violation.   According to the law ""No person shall tattoo or make a skin mark or cause any tattoo/skin mark to be made on a child"".  Various pigments are typically injected into the dermis to create tribal markings. The most effective removal technique is a q-switched laser. 
 Some tribal marks are associated with the thrones of certain towns, so that whoever becomes the king is expected to have the tribal mark that is associated with this traditional office. For example, it is still very much expected in Iseyin, Oyo State, that any new king will have the Pele tribal mark.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Africa_Ife_Head_1_Kimbell.jpg/220px-Africa_Ife_Head_1_Kimbell.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Scarification_in_Africa_in_the_early_1940s.jpg/220px-Scarification_in_Africa_in_the_early_1940s.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Facialmarks2.jpg/220px-Facialmarks2.jpg|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_tribal_marks

Despite this, even the brightest component is barely visible with the unaided eye  . No planets have yet been detected around any of the   in this system.
 This is a triple system with three stars that are all less massive than the  . The brightest component is designated HD 16160, and is known as Gliese 105 A. It is a  ,  about 70% the mass of the Sun.  This star is unusual because its eruptions appear to not conform to the Waldmeier effect—i.e., the strongest eruptions of HD 16160 are not the ones characterized by the fast eruption onset. 
 A nearby star has a similar   to Gliese 105 A, so it is assumed to be physically associated with the primary, and is known as Gliese 105 B. The two have an estimated separation of 1,200   (au). It is a   star whose brightness varies between 11.64 and 11.68 magnitudes; for that reason it has been given the designation BX Ceti. 
 A third companion, known as Gliese 105 C, lies much closer to A, currently at a distance of approximately 24 au.  The pair A-C have an estimated orbital period of about 70 years.  While detected directly, Gliese 105 C has also been observed to perturb Gliese 105 A from its usual position;  from that, its orbit is estimated to have a high eccentricity of around 0.64 and a semimajor axis of 17 au.  Gliese 105 C is an extremely faint  .  It is roughly 8 to 9 percent the mass of the Sun, and it is about 20,000 times fainter than its parent star in visible light—at a distance of 1 au (the distance from the Earth to the Sun) it would only be four times brighter than the full moon.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Jupiter_and_moon.png/20px-Jupiter_and_moon.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Gliese_105.gif/350px-Gliese_105.gif|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Cetus_constellation_map.svg/350px-Cetus_constellation_map.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Red_circle.svg/9px-Red_circle.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/16px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_105

en.wikipedia.org,1935 Jérémie hurricane - Wikipedia,"The   commonly referred to as the   was a highly destructive and catastrophic   that impacted the   and   in October 1935, killing well over 2,000 people. Developing on October 18 over the southwestern  , the storm proceeded to   eastern   and southeastern   while overwhelming southwestern Haiti in a deluge of rain. The hurricane—a   at its peak—completed an unusual reversal of its path on October 23, heading southwestward toward Central America. Weakened by its interaction with Cuba, the storm soon regained strength and made its final landfall near   in Honduras on October 25. The cyclone weakened upon moving inland and dissipated two days later.
 Flooding and landslides in Jamaica took their toll on property, agricultural interests, and infrastructure; fruit growers on the island sustained about $2.5 million (1935  ) in losses. Just off the coast, an unidentified vessel went down with her entire crew in the hostile conditions. Strong winds buffeted coastal sections of Cuba, notably in and around  . There, the hurricane demolished 100 homes and filled streets with debris. Only four people died in the country, thanks to the extensive pre-storm preparations. The storm did the most damage along the   of southwestern Haiti, where catastrophic river flooding took the lives of up to 2,000 individuals, razed hundreds of native houses, and destroyed crops and livestock. The heaviest destruction took place around the towns of   and  ; one early report estimated that 1,500 had been killed at the latter. Entire swaths of countryside were isolated for days, delaying both reconnaissance and relief efforts.
 The hurricane later created devastating floods in Central America, chiefly in Honduras. Reported at the time to be the worst flood in the nation's history, the disaster decimated banana plantations and population centers after rivers flowed up to 50 ft (15 m) above normal. Torrents of floodwaters trapped hundreds of citizens in trees, on rooftops, and on remote high ground, requiring emergency rescue. The storm left thousands homeless and around 150 dead in the country, while monetary losses totaled $12 million. Flooding and strong winds reached into northeastern Nicaragua, though damage was much less widespread than in neighboring Honduras.
 The hurricane originated over the southwestern Caribbean Sea, where, on October 17, a broad and immature   was noted. The   in Jacksonville, Florida issued its first advisory on the storm late on October 20, following ship reports of winds approaching and exceeding  .  Contemporary reanalyses of the storm have determined that it organized into a tropical depression on October 18, then drifted toward the east, turning north-northeastward as it strengthened into a tropical storm early the next day.  Due to low environmental air pressures and the large size of the cyclone, intensification was gradual as the storm approached  , eventually making landfall on the eastern side of the island, just west of the  , at 13:00   on October 21. The system came ashore with a central pressure of 995   (29.4  ), suggesting maximum winds of 60 mph (100 km/h).  After emerging into the waters between Jamaica and  , the storm slowed in forward speed, continued to intensify, and curved northwestward toward southeastern Cuba. The storm attained the equivalent of Category 1 hurricane status on the current-day   early on October 22, while meandering just off the coast of Cuba. 
 At around 18:00 UTC on October 22, the hurricane made landfall near   at its initial peak intensity, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h).  It started weakening early the next day after encountering the   mountain range and moving southwestward, away from the coast. Steered by persistent high-pressure   over the eastern United States and western Atlantic, the cyclone would maintain this highly unusual path for the remainder of its duration in open waters.  It brushed Cuba's   and deteriorated to a tropical storm before passing relatively close to the western tip of Jamaica.  On the morning of October 24, the barometer aboard a ship in the storm's   fell to 988 hPa (29.2 inHg), its lowest recorded pressure. The ship measured winds outside of the lull only up to 46 mph (74 km/h),  but the storm was reintensifying, and once again achieved hurricane strength later in the day.  It matched its previous peak intensity at 12:00 UTC on October 25 as it approached   on the border of   and  .  Shortly thereafter, the hurricane crossed the Honduran coast for its final landfall.  The mountainous terrain of Central America worked to diminish the storm, which curved westward and steadily lost force, though observation of its decay was minimal.  The cyclone likely dissipated on October 27 over Guatemala. 
 The hurricane affected Jamaica, Haiti, Cuba, Honduras, and North Nicaragua along its unusual path, killing an estimated 2,150 people. 
 Parts of eastern Jamaica began to experience strong northeasterly winds early on October 20, and the parishes of  ,  , and   ultimately bore the brunt of the storm.  Heavy rainfall swelled rivers and triggered landslides;  the ensuing floods destroyed bridges, inundated many homes, and necessitated the rescue of trapped individuals.  With telegraph communications cut to the hardest-hit areas and roads left impassable, the degree of destruction was initially uncertain, though it was described as ""extensive"".  The storm took a heavy toll on agriculture (already compromised from the effects of   less than a month earlier), with banana plantations in particular sustaining heavy damage.  Losses to fruit crops in the nation totaled an estimated $2,500,000. 
 The storm reportedly killed three people on the island.  An unidentified schooner capsized off   with all hands lost,  in spite of efforts to rescue the imperiled crew.  One modern source recounts that the crew numbered 31,  but this figure was not widely reported. The  , underway with    , averted its course after encountering adverse conditions. 
 In advance of the hurricane's landfall in Cuba, businesses were closed. Railways worked to secure non-essential trains, and residents of vulnerable coastal towns, including  , fled their homes in search of safer ground.  The hurricane subjected eastern parts of the island to intense gales, measured at over 70 mph (110 km/h) at Santiago de Cuba before the   failed.  The northern coast of the island around   also endured strong winds as high as 58 mph (93 km/h).  Winds of 60 mph (97 km/h) were recorded at the  , though the effects there were generally light. Closer to the hurricane's center, in Santiago de Cuba, about 100 homes sustained complete structural failures.  The prolonged nature of the storm hampered search and rescue efforts amid the rubble.  Winds strew debris around the city,  blocking its streets.  A hospital and a power plant both suffered roof failure.  Electricity in Santiago de Cuba was preemptively turned off as conditions worsened,  contributing to regional power outages.  
 Significant flooding occurred after the   overflowed its banks,  making driving impossible.  The storm severed communications between towns in eastern Cuba after bringing down telephone and telegraph wires.  Apart from seven structures ruined in the   area,  there was less destruction in many locations than initially feared.  There were reports of three fatalities in Caimanera, and one person died in Santiago de Cuba.  At least 29 individuals were treated for storm-related injuries.  Damage assessments in the immediate aftermath of the storm placed monetary damages in Cuba at $500,000.  In the aftermath, a public curfew was issued for Santiago de Cuba, forcing residents to remain indoors after 8 pm. To prevent looting, troops patrolled streets and vulnerable locations, such as banks.  Supplies of bread and milk ran short following the hurricane. 
 The greatest disaster occurred in southern  , where as many as 2,000 people died,  possibly more.  The towns of   and  —both on the  —were devastated by catastrophic freshwater flooding after days of torrential rains. The entire peninsula, already remote in its own right, was isolated for a time, ensuring only scant detail of the disaster reached the outside world.  Information was initially relayed to the capital city of   by a single aircraft. 
 Populations of valley villages were believed to have been wiped out as rains sent the streams from the channels, demolishing the frail, thatched huts of the natives.
 The hurricane crippled infrastructure, blocking roads throughout the area and destroying a   plant in Jacmel. The town was left without power and drinking water.  In Jérémie, the flooding was so severe as to sweep away a large metal bridge. Hundreds of poorly constructed native houses were destroyed on the Tiburon Peninsula, leaving thousands of survivors without homes.  Property damage in Haiti amounted to over $1 million.  Meanwhile, thousands of livestock were killed and crops were completely destroyed, prompting fears of impending famine. 
 Several days after the storm, the bodies of drowning victims had been recovered by the hundreds,  and it was suspected many of the deceased had been washed into the sea.  One preliminary estimate placed the number of dead in the Jérémie area alone at 1,500,  suggesting the worst of the tragedy occurred there. Indeed, some modern sources have unofficially referred to the storm as  .  The Haitian government worked to bring emergency supplies and relief workers, at least partially by way of ship, to the flood-stricken region. As little was known about the extent of losses, officials rushed to restore communications with the disaster area. 
 After clearing the  , the hurricane ravaged parts of Honduras. Banana plantations suffered extensively,  causing the   about $6 million in losses. As in Haiti, the hardest hit areas of Honduras were cut off from the nation's capital of  .  Severe river flooding wrought widespread destruction, especially around   and throughout the  .  Many towns were inundated by up to 7 ft (2.1 m) of water.  According to one source, the   ""officially"" rose some 50 ft (15 m) from its normal height near  ,  where the flood left 800 families homeless.  Many hundreds of individuals were stranded by raging flood waters in the Cortés region, clutching to trees and rooftops as they awaited uncertain rescue.  Even after rescue boats brought many residents of Chamelecón to safety, a third of the population remain trapped. 
 The rampant   reportedly obliterated an entire suburban community further east, near La Ceiba,  while the   burst its banks at   and killed numerous plantation workers. By October 29, the bodies of 70 flood victims had been recovered at Corocito in  .  Torrential rains extended into Tegucigalpa, causing  .  Just to the northeast, in  , a large landslide took the lives of at least three people.  Overall, the hurricane inflicted about $12 million in damage across Honduras (including the agricultural impacts),  resulted in about 150 deaths,  and destroyed the homes of thousands of residents.  The floods were considered to be among the worst in the country's history.  Almost immediately after the passage of the storm, a wide area of Honduras experienced strong earthquake activity. 
 Damaging, but less expansive, floods also occurred in parts of extreme northeastern   around the  .  The  , which constitutes a large portion of the Honduras–Nicaragua border, swelled 40 ft (12 m) as observed about 140 mi (230 km) upstream of its mouth.  Banana farms were heavily damaged around Cabo Gracias a Dios, occupied by both nations, and according to early reports in that area, all but a handful of dwellings were destroyed. In spite of the flooding and hurricane-force winds, timely warnings prevented fatalities locally.",https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/19px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/1935_Atlantic_hurricane_6_map_October_24.jpg/220px-1935_Atlantic_hurricane_6_map_October_24.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/1935_Atlantic_hurricane_6_track.png/275px-1935_Atlantic_hurricane_6_track.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Disc_Plain_black.svg/18px-Disc_Plain_black.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Solid_black.svg/18px-Solid_black.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/ArrowUp.svg/18px-ArrowUp.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/1935_Atlantic_hurricane_6_map_October_22.jpg/220px-1935_Atlantic_hurricane_6_map_October_22.jpg|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Cyclone_Catarina_from_the_ISS_on_March_26_2004.JPG/32px-Cyclone_Catarina_from_the_ISS_on_March_26_2004.JPG|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/1935_Atlantic_hurricane_season_summary_map.png/100px-1935_Atlantic_hurricane_season_summary_map.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/16px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e2/Symbol_portal_class.svg/16px-Symbol_portal_class.svg.png|https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png|https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png|https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1935_J%C3%A9r%C3%A9mie_hurricane

 One of the primary goals of this project is to make artificial intelligence articles  , so you should make an effort to  .
 Try to ensure that every artificial intelligence article includes at least a few relevant references, and direct citations for anything that could be considered controversial. Wikipedia articles cannot be a substitute for a textbook (that is what   is for), and references can give readers some idea of where they should go if they need more information  than the article can provide. Just as important, providing further reading enables other editors to verify and to extend the given information, as well as to discuss the quality of a particular source.

en.wikipedia.org,Johann Cesar VI. Godeffroy - Wikipedia,"(7 July 1813 in   – 9 February 1885 in  ) was a German  ,   and  .
 He was the founder of  .
 The Godeffroys were   of  . In 1737 they were forced to flee France to avoid religious persecution after events following the   in 1685. The family sought asylum in Prussia and finally settled in the port city of Hamburg, founding a trading empire known as J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn. At first the trade was in Western Europe and the West Indies with textiles as export item; the goods returning to Hamburg included copper, coffee, wine,  , and sugar from  . Under Johann Cesar VI Godeffroy outposts were established in   and in  . He built a fleet of trading ships that, at its peak, numbered 29 deep water sailing vessels and some 100 smaller ships.  Among these ships were the    ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and until the economic crisis of 1857, the renowned American-built clipper  .   In 1855, trade was expanded into the Pacific following negotiations by Godeffroy's agent in Valparaiso, August Unselm. He sailed out to the  ,  , Fiji, and finally  .
 The trading business in the Pacific was very profitable and new outposts and plantations were established on many Pacific Islands. The goods were  ,   and luxuries such as  , as well as slaves (see  ). In 1857, a central outpost, directing Pacific operations was established at  . Johann Godeffroy was also able to take advantage of an immigration scheme to Southern Africa and between October 1859 and September 1883 no less than 36 ships sailed for southern Africa, bringing hundreds of German families to the  , the  ,   and  . 
After the  , the firm supplemented its revenue by taking on passengers to the   and the  . The German imperial government utilized the Godeffroy company as part of its colonial policy in the Pacific Islands. Nevertheless, in 1878, the company went bankrupt due to speculations with German mining stocks and then emerged as  , or DHPG, with continuity and management by Godeffroy personnel. 
 Johann Godeffroy attended the town school of   of   from about 1821 to 1830, as did his younger brothers and his older brother Gustav Adolph. He then trained at Parish & Co.  whose owner Richard Parish was married to Susanne Godeffroy, a daughter of Peter Godeffroy, brother of his grandfather. An internship in England followed. Towards the end of 1835, he joined his father's company, ""J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn"" and on 1 January 1837 he became a shareholder. After the death of his father Johann Cesar Godeffroy (1781–1845) on 3 July 1845 he took over the company. In this year he was elected to the  .
From 1846 the company negotiated partnerships and mergers with various companies notably ""Elb-Kupferwerk"" (copper ore processors) and    (shipbuilders). In 1857 he took control of the newly established ""L. R. Beit, Gold- und Silber-Affinerie"" now  . Other business arrangements were made with ""Tesdorf FJ & Son"", ""Elbhütte Affinir- und Handelsgesellschaft"" and ""Elb-Zuckersiederei"" (sugar refiners). In these years also co-founded the North German Bank and the North German Insurance Company. Due to lack of liquidity the company J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn at the end of 1879 began legal process with its creditors. This took over 30 years but finally in 1913 the company name ""J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn"" was erased from the Register.
 On 2 February 1837 Johann Cesar Godeffroy married Emily Hanbury (1815–1894) whose family had close trading ties with  . The couple had five children, with Johann Cesar Godeffroy (1838–1912), the eldest son. His brother Gustav Godeffroy was a Senator for the city of Hamburg in the   and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of  . His brother, Adolph Godeffroy in 1847 was co-founder of the passenger line ""Hamburg-Amerikanischen Packetfahrt-AG“  "" (HAPAG) and until 1880 the presiding director.
 During the winter months the family lived in the upper floors of a house in the Old Wandrahm inside Hamburg, office spaces occupied the lower floor. This house was built around 1760. The rest of the year they lived far outside the city Dockenhuden, today a part of Blankenese  in a cottage built by the Danish architect   in 1789  .
Nearby, in the area known as Iserbrook, he planted extensive woodlands where Hamburg bourgeoisie, notably  ,  ,     and   were entertained at a tennis club. This is now Hirschpark  . He also established a  .
In June 1836 with his younger brother, Adolph,  , Charles Parish, Dr.  , Dr.   and five other enthusiasts he founded the 
 . It is the oldest rowing club on the European continent and still exists today.
From 1859 to 1864 he sat as a member of the Hamburg Parliament.
 Starting Pacific trading in   and supported by merged, partner companies, share-holders (including  ) and bankers in Hamburg and under the close direction of Johann Caesar Godeffroy the company was soon throughout the South Seas,   with centres of operation at Apia and Valparaiso, and a fleet of trading barques, brigs and schooners, which traded through the islands from China to the Pacific coast flying the company colours – a white flag with a ribboned golden dove on a blue horizontal bar with golden stripes, below the bar is a blue inscription: ""J.C.G. & S. In Apia the company supplied arms and ammunition from an armaments subsidiary at  . These were supplied to the warring factions on Apia in exchange for 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) of the finest alluvial soil soon transformed into plantations of, mainly, copra or coconut oil, pearl-shell or sea-island cotton. These were worked by over 1,000 labourers imported from Melanesia. Another plantation of 1,200 hectares (3,000 acres) was later started at Yap in the   and in 1873 trading posts were established in the  .
 In 1865 in the Ellice Group (now  ) the company obtained a 25-year lease to the eastern islet of Niuoku of   Atoll.   For many years the islanders and the company argued over the lease, including its terms and the importation of labourers, however the company remained until the lease expired in 1890. 
 At Apia they had a shipbuilding yard and repairing sheds. The ships never insured and their captains were paid commission of three per cent, on the net profit of each voyage. Ships always left Apia under sealed orders to disguise their intentions from competitors. More innovative was the introduction of debased South American currencies as the sole means of exchange so controlling the money.
 Beginning as a personal collection of birds, shells, fish, and other animals, as well as cultural objects from all localities visited by the Godeffroy ships, Godeffroy's natural history cabinet grew in size until it occupied a cluttered warehouse. It was time to find a proper place to house, list, organize, and finally display them to a fascinated public, and in 1860 Godeffroy wrote to Dr.   (1833–1919) in Switzerland to request his services in founding a museum. The 28-year-old Swiss zoologist accepted and boarded a train for Hamburg in 1861. After a short time the   was founded, and Graeffe was sent to the Pacific in October 1861 to supervise the acquisition of more material. Graeffe settled in Apia and directed the Godeffroy operations there for the next decade while also collecting in Tahiti, Fiji, Tonga, Australia, Samoa, and other South Pacific Islands. Other scientific collectors were hired by the company who, working in different areas of the Pacific Ocean, helped increase the holdings of the Museum with their successful collecting of birds, mammals, fishes, shells, butterflies, beetles and other insects, plants, and   objects. The museum also functioned as a natural history dealership. On the establishment of the museum, Godeffroy was made an honorary member of the  .
